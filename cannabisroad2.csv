There is no such thing as a hacker and scam-proof traditional escrow market.  That big pool of bitcoins in traditional escrow markets is too big a temptation for thieves and rogue admins.  The bigger and more successful a market gets, the worse the problem is because the pile of bitcoins gets bigger and bigger.  Let's put an end to traditional escrow starting now.  I don't know if CR has the financial ability to repay the loss.  If they can, great.  But that by itself isn't enough.  CR  is a great market with great vendors and great staff, but they have also demonstrated that they aren't up to the job of keeping traditional escrow funds safe.  I don't think any market is capable of keeping traditional escrow funds safe, so that's not a criticism of Crypto specifically, but an indictment of traditional escrow everywhere.  Let's learn a lesson from this at least.

I am devastated to announce that we have officially been robbed of around $100,000 USD.  Shortly after 10:15 AM UTC, I logged on to check on some things to notice that the balance of our wallet was near zero. At first I thought it was a mistake, until I double checked, and triple checked, only to find out, we had in fact been robbed not 15 minutes earlier!  All coins were sent to this address.   http://blockchain.info/address/1CatnMd3jsEKhwhSLUf8V862im8gBp3NDF  At this point, I still have no idea how the coins were stolen, or who was involved. I am not, and will not, blame transaction malleability.   Once I find out how the coins were stolen, I am going to share as much information as possible to prevent this from happening to other markets.   I don't know if Cannabis Road will continue to exist or not at this point, because there may be no reasonable way for us to recover from this. But now I know how Defcon felt, because I know a substantial number of you will be pointing the finger at myself, Crypto.  I am deeply sorry that I have failed you as a developer and a leader, and if I can figure out how this happened, maybe you will find it in your hearts to move past this and help us bring Cannabis Road back to life once again.

I do like pissing off.  But that's because I only know LAZY devs that pass the buck which usually ends up on my plate.

I really like the cart that can contain multiple vendor orders at once.  It makes it easy to 'bookmark' some purchases. I think a few enhancements would make it much nicer. Cart: 1.  Make the Product Name a clickable link that will bring you to the original listing. 2.  Make the Seller Name a clickable link that will bring you to the seller's profile page 3.  If you have an item in your cart and the item has gone out of stock then display wording, an icon, or modify the listing picture with an ""Out of stock"" overlay. 4.  Similar to #3, if the pricing changes while it is in your cart.  If you go to check out it should warn you that the price has changed (sorry if it already does this, i can't verify at the moment) Orders: 1.  Be able to clear your own order history.    I think this should clear the specific details out but retain the number of orders and approximate amounts.   This way vendors can see that you have made orders, not a scammer, etc. 2.  Are vendors able to comment/rate buyers?  If so, I think the user should be able to see their own rating/feedback.

That'll be the way to search when you already know the products and vendors on the road.   FAVORITE VENDORS You'll also be able to have a  QUICK access to your Favorite vendors on the left panel above the BTC Exchange Rates. (I'll explain that later on how it's done from the Vendors Profile page)    THE MAIN LISTINGS FRAME  Now lets get to what is in front of you now on the  home page. You should be  seeing listings of various products which are  randomly selected and shown. Not the best way for you to find what you need.  Now  lets sort this out a little bit.  Your  filter is shown in the  PRODUCTS bar:   Choose how you want your search results to be arranged:  Random is default but in the scroll bar you can choose to have it sorted by:  NEW/OLD,  PRICE (Highest or Lowest First),  SIZE (Big or Small first),  BEST SELLERS, BEST RATINGS, MOST VIEWS, NAME  The tick box for  SHIPS TO MY REGION is most useful, as it will remove all listings that you couldn't order anyways,  leaving what you CAN buy visible. This setting will know what is YOUR REGION as the country you entered in Your Profile (Explained in the Setting Up an Account Tutorial).  Tick the  SHIPS FROM MY REGION also to only have domestic sellers listings show up. (If from a small country chances are that there are no domestic sellers so you'll get 0 results, just untick it.  Also some vendors set the shipping country to Undisclosed so they would get knocked out from your search despite being domestic)  Then  Hit The UPDATE bar. You've set the basic filters that way, it can be modified any time druring your session. It is reseted to random everytime you log in.   Now to the  MAIN PRODUCT SEARCH    PRODUCT CATEGORIES.  It's quite clear what they mean... Cannabis is weed, etc... Each  CATEGORY allows access to  SUB-CATEGORIES when hitting the + plus button next to the category. (some categories don't really have subcatgories it'll just take you to ALL)  For example: CANNABIS gives you access to these categories: INDICA, HYBRID, and SATIVA.  Just  click on the Category or Sub Category you're interested in and  search resuslts will appear sorted according to your filters you've just set up previously.  Most often there are  more than 1 search result pages. You'll find access to the other pages at the bottom below the listings with a ""Previous 1 2 ...15 Next""    bar to navigate through the pages.  Now you've hit the search and have found results,   You can see on the search page Pictures and Listing Descriptions.     The SEARCH PAGE LISTING DESCRIPTION:  *The  PICTURE *The  LISTING Description * VENDOR INFORMATION with the vendors Name, his  Feedback average out of 5 (5 being best) and  the number of sales he's done on the market. *The  PRICE in Your CURRENCY (the one set in Your Profile - see the Tutorial for setting up the account for help) converted from the price in BiTCoins below. * WEIGHT of the item. (often also stated in the listing Descrition)   Clicking on the PHOTO or the DESCRIPTION will take you to the  FULL LISTING description.  Clicking on the VENDOR NAME will take you to the  VENDORS PROFILE page with loads of Important Information (will be explained below in the tutorial).     The FULL LISTING PAGE:  * You'll find a  Large Photo of the item here withe the  Listing Description and the Price for the amount lsted.  * The  Shipment Policy of the Seller:  Where he Ships From and Where He Ships To.  * The different  Shipping Options in the scroll box. BE CAREFUL WHEN SELECTING that you chose the right shipping option for you and your country. Some sellers also offer Tracked services, so make sure you're clicking on what you really want and most importantly FOR YOUR COUNTRY.  * The  ESCROW Type: Traditionnal Escrow (based on the C Road site) Or Multi-Signature Escrow (not always offered).  I'll explain traditionnal escrow and how the payment is done in another tutorial. There is also a tutorial for multi-sig escrow which is quite a bit more complicated and not necessarely a newbie firendly method to start off buying. So chose Traditionnal Escrow for the time.  *  Quantity: Type in the amount of the item you want (Note that sellers often sell diferrent quantities at cheaper prices the bigger, you can see those in that Vendors other listings)  *The  ADD TO CART Button will do exactly that when clicked. Your will then  be taken to your Shopping Cart Ready for Checkout if you're done shopping.   * SELLER: Name You can click on the sellers name to access the Vendors Profile from here also.  * Below is the  FULL PRODUCT DESCRIPTION  You usually find  information on the product, the vendors stealth, shipment delays, etc...   Other Very useful information is found on the Vendors Profile page (Remember you can click on the vendors profile by clicking on his name below the ADD TO CART Button.   YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED TO CONSULT THE VENDORS PROFILE ALSO before buying. (See the use of using multiple tabs here    * Below that is the  RECENT FEEDBACK received by the VENDOR  ON THIS SPECIFIC LISTING Feedback from sales of his other listings can be found on the Vendors Profile).  That Sums up the Listings Page  Since we need to check to Vendors Profile anyways for several things lets do that now.     VENDORS PROFILE So either click: *  From the Listing Page on the vendors name below the ADD to CART button.  OR *  From the Search Result Page on the vendors name above the feedback star. or *  From the Top Search Bar by typing the Vendors username and selecting Vendor from the scrollbox. You'll have to click on the user name again on the result page. (Least practical way)   text here   PROTECTING YOURSELF AND CHOOSING A VENDOR   YOU ALL NEED TO READ THE FIRST POST OF THIS TOPIC ABOUT AVOIDING SCAMMING VENDORS WHEN YOU CHOSE A VENDOR It has Great Guidelines to follow  http://forumzxmoorof4ja.onion/index.php?topic=243.0   THE CHOICE OF A VENDOR IS IMPORTANT. Read the  feedbacks on the Vendors Profile to see all his activity profile, check the  feedback on the listing page to see feedback for that item.   READ THE FORUM. Check the  OFFICIAL VENDOR REVIEW THREAD for information on vendors. Protect yourself!!! And help protect others by posting on the forums.   ",

White Widow  60/40 INDOOR. Sativa majority: SOLD OUT Photos courtesy of Dorgeshuun:   Shishka Berry  70/30 INDOOR. Highest moisture content out of all 5. Sweet-spicy smoke. Contains leaf and shake.   In reference to when I said to heat the nail for several minutes. Glass nails heat up much, much quicker than titanium nails.  ","Quote from: lightbeing on March 07, 2014, 06:01:21 amAlright quick review for Fuschia Trainwreck!Texture/Appearance- Good trim, dense nugs, very crystally and well cured.Smell- Pretty strong smell that stinks up my room if the bag is left open. Smells piney, earthy and just a bit citrusy.Taste- Sweet/pineyHigh- The head high comes on quick and is quite clear and a nice body high ensues shortly after. 1 bowl got me high enough but I took 3-4 and it became hard to focus on what I was watching  Overall I give it a 89/100(not being generous) for indoor and a great deal. Will definitely do more business.I will almost second this exact post. I give it a little bit higher of a score because when I cracked a few buds open, and broke them down, I could definitely understand the Fuchsia name.Stealth: Incredible, can't ask for more really.Appearance: It looks as I would expect from 100% sativa, long/stringy but much denser than any sativa I've had in the past. Colors are amazing as the nugs have plenty of purple on them, and when you break it open you can see the Fuchsia,  you can definitely see the crystals dripping.Taste/Smell: Tastes just like it smells.. sweet and piney. The smell stunk up my whole place as soon as I cracked the package.High:  I absolutely love the head high I get from smoking just one bowl of this stuff. Although, I'm a blunt kind of guy and a blunt of it has had me and a buddy talking our heads off about philosophical nonsense as opposed to our usual video gaming in silence for at least an hour now. My personal rating is a 9.4/10. I have smoked basically every day for the past 10 years, and this is easily one of my favorite strains I've come in contact so far. Now take that with a grain of salt because unfortunately my location for those past 10 years has not exactly provided me with the high quality greenery until recent.;I can smoke a joint of this and I'm good to go for a few hours. As far as couch-lock goes, I'm not getting that at all, just nice and relaxed. The Black Cherry Cheesecake is the perfect TV companion. It's a great evening smoke. I like the slight piney flavor of it too, plus it is a nice mellow smoke. Not at all harsh.;Black Cherry Cheesecakehttp://infotombjhy7tcrg.onion/vembx.jpghttp://infotombjhy7tcrg.onion/7z57j.jpgFor the review part of this post:10/10 Shipping - I ordered Friday and it arrived Monday. Very happy with the shipping time.10/10 Stealth - Stealth was as expected and immediately after the first layer was opened, you could smell something. Had to open the other layers to get to the weed.8/10 Product - I have only tried the Black Cherry Cheesecake so far, and it is very fluffy with A LOT of purple it in. Quite happy with the smoke too. Exciting taste to it. Not out of this world dank, but still highly up there.Overall I am very happy with my purchase and plan to order again. Probably going to grab that wax.;Got my order yesterday! Just finalized today, sorry about the delay, cable company had outages yesterday and was unable to get online until today.I ordered a QP of the Black Cherry Cheesecake and a gram of the G13 wax.  Ordered Monday, received Friday, so shipping time was alright - not outstanding but not bad considering I'm on the East Coast. The bud was very good, not super top shelf, but damn great for the price!! Will get top shelf dollar around here! It wasn't the same purple buds as pictured in this thread and on BC's profile.. no purple at all, so may have got subbed out or something, but still is great bud and I have no complaints!  Not too dense, not to fluffy, good trim job.. hint of some stickyness.. no moist spots, everything seems level throughout the buds, so def good cure job.  The QP was almost 3 grams heavy, love it! Thanks!!!Also, thanks for your response to my question about consuming the wax, Trappy! I'll prob give the wax a try tonight or tomorrow and come back with a review of that.Overall BudCentral is a 10 out of 5!!! Far exceeded my expectations when considering quality to price ratio, it really is unbelievable folks!  Will be back for a HP next week for sure!;Review: QP Black Cherry Cheesecake, 3 grams HashSpeed:  4 days to midwest (including holiday w/no mail) 5/5Stealth: 5/5Hash: 5/5 as advertised, very potentQP: 4/5 not as advertised, different product than orderedOver all it was a good experience, other than not getting the purple strain I ordered, as people here were wanting that product. What arrived was similar to the earlier review, decent manicure, very fresh MJ. I am under the impression that this MJ was not fully cured to its potential.Product (MJ) was a bit stemmy, no shake, some leaves but nothing outrageous. The smell was very fresh not cured and to be honest it turned a couple of people off, but most understood the freshness being the situation. The buds were impressive for the most part, a few too many sticks IMO, but no shake to speak of in the QP and was a bit over in weight.I think these guys run a pretty tight ship, I wish that I would have gotten a message saying what strain it was that I did receive if there were going to be a replacement. Really my only complaint. Buds were sugary and very pretty.;Just received an order of the black cherry cheese cake. 10/10 for shipping. Ordered thursday, and recieved it by tuesday the following week. Stealth was very good. Everything you would want from a good vendor. 8/10 for the bud. Very good for the price. Crystally, with flecks of purple. Only downside is that it is stemmy. Not a problem though. The bag was way overweight, which makes up for any stems. Definitely ordering from budcentral again.;http://infotombjhy7tcrg.onion/pjjx9.jpghttp://infotombjhy7tcrg.onion/sbah2.jpg;I think this is my favorite strain so far. I love the spicey taste of this and the fruity exhale. Very nice and a great mellow buzz. This is my third order with BudCentral. I've been happy with the product and service every time. ;So my first time dabbing was an awesome one.  Got high as hell!!!  Kept hearing dabbing was like smoking for the first time and that's what I was hoping for, super intense and giggly, however it didn't end up that way.  Very clear, long-lasting intense high though.  So overall I loved the G13 wax.  Can't really rate it as I have nothing to compare to.Also, I have to agree with wintermute.. my propane torch makes my nail start glowing red hot in about 15 seconds of direct flame application.;G13 wax rev      (weighed way over!)overall 9.5/10 fucking great waxLooks: 9/10 fucking fire pure gold a lil crumblySmell: 10/10  smell is the best i have had from a wax very strong pine/citrus just amazing!!! High: 10/10 very potentTaste: 9/10 smooth taste just like smell ;Review for G13 Wax!Okay it took me about 2 days to write this, I've been busy and really really really high. Taste- A good taste can't really describe it though.Smell- Very sweet, similar to bubblegum but not exactly.Appearance/Texture- Golden, crumbly wax.High- Instant and VERY clear head high. This is my first time dabbing and I must say I now know why it is so addicting. I could dab all day. Since I have nothing else to compare this wax to I'll give it 95/100."

My post was less about your particular situation, and more about big picture concepts to ease the mind, not necessarily to make excuses.. Ironically, find myself in nearly the same situation as you, with a different vendor...  Trying to keep it all in perspective when the stash jar is low and the mailbox is empty...again...is not easy at all.  So it goes in the bud in a box game.   The biggest picture to keep always in mind, is that anything from CR is better than anything I can get around here...so we wait and stalk our mailboxes.   Are we having fun yet???    ","PW- I get what you are saying but the fact is that business is business and personal problems are no excuse. Are we understanding if the cable guy who comes for a service call fucks up your cable and internet because his cat died and he's distracted? If you ordered say, a belt, from a small leather merchant on the net and he didn't sent you your merchandise for a month and ignored your messages would you say ""oh well, maybe he has a rash"". So you contracted transiberian itch, that sucks but tough, if its so much of an issue that your business starts to suffer than put your shit on vacation mode and get it sorted. right?    "

I received my order 17 days after purchase, 9 days after my message on this thread.  I sent this vendor 3 messages ( beginning after 7 business days) the first 2 were ignored completely and the 3rd got this response - ""getting it ready"". Stealth on the package was fine, pretty standard stuff. Weight came in at 28.5.  Quality was fine also, not great but good for the price I guess. Overall its two big thumbs down, there are only four metrics with which one can judge a vendor, shipping, comms, stealth, and quality. Bud Central's score is as follows; Shipping- 1/5, Comms- 2/5, Stealth- 5/5, Quality- 3/5 for a total of 11/20 (55/100)  or 55%, a failing grade any way you slice it. One could try and explain away the sub par overall quality by saying things like BC is a top vendor and as such, is super busy, or BC was a vendor of the month for June and has an excess of orders coming in from that but I don't buy those excuses. I just purchased from DR. Greenthumb, who is also a top vendor and was VOM for July and that transaction was flawless, 5/5 on everything.   TL;DR: BC scores 55 out of 100%, an F (my personal opinion) ",

Period. Bottom line. If you have to continue arguing for legalization after that point you are probably arguing with someone so deep in the kool-aid they will never be coming back (the metaphorical chess-shitting pigeon). If in doubt, ask someone this question: ""Should the government be allowed to take organs from people? Say there is a 7 year old girl who really needs a kidney and the government decides she needs a kidney more than you need two kidneys. Is it OK for the government to forcibly take your kidney from you under threat of imprisonment?"" If they answer that they would ""of course,"" give the girl a kidney, just keep playing with the variables until they start to understand the full picture. ""What if she was 12 instead of 7?"" ""What if it was a 22 year old male police officer who needed a kidney?"" ""What if it was a politician?"" ""What government agency would end up responsible for making the decisions of who gets to keep their kidneys and who doesn't, and do you think they would do a good job?"" Etc....if they don't end up seeing the problem just take my advice and call it a day.  If they answer that the government should be allowed to take your kidney whenever they deem it necessary they are a very sick individual and you should distance yourself from them immediately in my opinion. If they answer with anything else you have just set the framework for their understanding. Keep in mind this is not about donating a kidney, this is about being TOLD you are mandated to give up a kidney and have no choice in the matter.     If people want to get fucked up, they are going to get fucked up. It is our duty as a society to recognize this need and allow people to pursue it as safely as possible. How about instead of criminalizing things like heroin and locking people up for using it, we focus all that energy on education? Really explain to people what these drugs are and how they work, not just that they are bad/evil/poisonous. Because the truth is that with moderation most things are just fine, as long as you know the risks involved.   And when it comes down to it, who cares if someone wants to spend all their days nodding out on H? That should not be a crime. Now, if that person decides to start committing larcenies in order to feed their habit, that would of course be unwanted and something they should be locked up for.  BUT THAT SHOULD BE THE DIFFERENCE! If you want to sit in your home in peace and fill your body with 6 pounds of meth a day I really couldn't care less, and I do not think anyone should be allowed to LOCK YOU IN A CAGE for doing this. However, if you want to cross the line into stealing from other people to pay for your habit, at that point I have no problem with some punitive measures.    My thoughts on Marijuana as a gate-way drug is that the issue is not just that dealers have it as well as hard drugs. I think this isn't even the case most of the time, most street level weed dealers are pretty strictly weed. I think Marijuana is a ""gateway drug"" because they CLASS mj in the same category as all the other hardest/most dangerous drugs, and then everyone quickly finds out they were lied to and MJ is actually incredibly safe. After one finds that information out, questions like this occur: ""what else were they lying to me about? If they told me weed was this terrible horrible stuff and I find out it's amazing, maybe the same is true for heroin."" And there you go. All of a sudden this child you have LIED TO for years on end is now questioning everything they have learned regarding drug education and made your entire fucking program worthless.    STOP LYING TO CHILDREN. STOP IMPRISONING PEOPLE WHO AREN'T ACTUALLY DOING ANYTHING WRONG.

When the ""enemy"" or ""bad guy"" is on the same side as you, you may want to rethink your stance on the subjectThat's actually a very good point. One that's valid for dealers of any type of drugs. So my next question :What about legalizing all drugs? I read somewhere addiction should be considered as a disease and treated as such. I think legalizing all drugs would be a good way to get to know and help all users who do have an addiction problem. I know there's something that feels wrong with the idea of making drugs like H or Crystal Meth legal. But the point is to eventually help people in need. What's your view on this one?"

Since then, those caught with small amounts of marijuana, cocaine or heroin go unindicted and possession is a misdemeanor on par with illegal parking. Experts are pleased with the results.   http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/evaluating-drug-decriminalization-in-portugal-12-years-later-a-891060.html   http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/evaluating-drug-decriminalization-in-portugal-12-years-later-a-891060-2.html  ","Before he got involved in the global war on drugs, João Goulão was a family physician with his own practice in Faro, on Portugal's Algarve coast. Arriving in his small office in Lisbon, the 58-year-old tosses his jacket aside, leaving his shirt collar crooked. He looks a little tired from the many trips he's taken lately -- the world wants to know exactly how the experiment in Portugal is going. Goulão is no longer able to accept all the invitations he receives. He adds his latest piece of mail to the mountain of papers on his desk.From this office, where the air conditioning stopped working this morning, Goulão keeps watch over one of the world's largest experiments in drug policy.One gram of heroin, two grams of cocaine, 25 grams of marijuana leaves or five grams of hashish: These are the drug quantities one can legally purchase and possess in Portugal, carrying them through the streets of Lisbon in a pants pocket, say, without fear of repercussion. MDMA -- the active ingredient in ecstasy -- and amphetamines -- including speed and meth -- can also be possessed in amounts up to one gram. That's roughly enough of each of these drugs to last 10 days.These are the amounts listed in a table appended to Portugal's Law 30/2000. Goulão participated in creating this law, which has put his country at the forefront of experimental approaches to drug control. Portugal paved a new path when it decided to decriminalize drugs of all kinds.""We figured perhaps this way we would be better able get things under control,"" Goulão explains. ""Criminalization certainly wasn't working all that well.""Much the Same as a Parking ViolationAs part of its war on drugs, Portugal has stopped prosecuting users. The substances listed in the Law 30/2000 table are still illegal in Portugal -- ""Otherwise we would have gotten into trouble with the UN,"" Goulão explains -- but using these drugs is nothing more than a misdemeanor, much the same as a parking violation.Why set the limits on these drugs at 10 days' worth of use, though?""Well, it's a limit, which by its nature is arbitrary,"" Goulão says. Now the head of Portugal's national anti-drug program and an important figure in Portuguese health policy, he still talks like an easygoing family doctor. Arrayed on Goulão's windowsill are photographs, including one of him with Richard Branson, the British billionaire and hot air balloon operator. Another shows Goulão with the king of Spain. Both these men have received personal briefings on Portugal's new drug program from Goulão.""At the point when we designed the law, we had hardly any data to draw on,"" Goulão relates. ""We weren't the least bit certain this would work.""The question at stake: How can a government keep its citizens from taking dangerous drugs? One way is to crack down on those who provide the drugs -- the cartels, the middle men and the street dealers. Another approach is to focus on the customers -- arresting them, trying them and imprisoning them. Legal prosecution -- as both a control mechanism and a deterrent -- is the chosen approach for most governments.Giving Up on the Idea of a Drug-Free World""It's important that we prevent people from buying drugs, and taking drugs, using every method at our disposal,"" says Manuel Pinto Coelho, 64, the last great opponent of Goulão's experiment. Pinto Coelho wants his country to return to normalcy, in the form of the tough war on drugs that much of the rest of the world conducts.Pinto Coelho is a doctor too. He has run rehab centers and written books about addiction. Now he's at odds with former colleagues and with ""the system,"" as he says.His greatest concern is that his country has given up on the idea of a drug-free world. How, Pinto Coelho asks, is it possible to keep young people away from drugs, when everyone knows exactly how many pills can legally be carried around? He still believes deterrents are the best form of prevention and that cold turkey withdrawal is the best treatment method. He is also fighting the extensive methadone program Portugal began as part of its drug policy reform, which now provides tens of thousands of heroin addicts with this substitute drug.These days, Pinto Coelho earns his living running diet clinics, but he spends his evenings writing letters and drafting presentations on his country's ""absurd drug experiment."" He travels to symposiums to warn the rest of the world of its dangers. At home in Portugal, his critical perspective has made him an outsider, but he says he's been well received abroad. As if offering proof, he shows a fact sheet issued by the United States Office of National Drug Control Policy, a brief and skeptically worded report on the Portuguese experiment.The Freedom that Overwhelmed the CountryWhen João Goulão wants to explain why it is Portugal in particular that came up with the idea to stop prosecuting drug users, he starts with the country's Carnation Revolution.In 1974, Portugal broke free from nearly 50 years of military dictatorship, a political shift symbolized by the carnations soldiers stuck in the muzzles of their rifles.""Suddenly, the drugs were there,"" Goulão says, as Portuguese returning from the country's overseas colonies brought marijuana with them. Goulão, too, says he smoked pot back then. He was in his early twenties and ""drugs promised us freedom.""But it was a freedom that soon overwhelmed the country. When Goulão established his doctor's practice in Faro, he soon found himself approached by parents whose children were no longer just smoking joints, but had moved on to heroin. Sometimes the children came to him as well, and Goulão had no idea how to treat them. When the first state-run rehab clinic opened in Lisbon, Goulão attended a training course there.At that point, he says, the heroin epidemic was just beginning.In the 1980s, cheap heroin from Afghanistan and Pakistan began flooding Europe. Portugal was not the only country affected, but Goulão says his nation was hit particularly hard, because people here had little idea how to handle drugs. ""We were naïve,"" he says.The number of people taking illegal drugs in Portugal was low compared with other countries, but of those who did consume drugs, an unusually high number of them fell into the category that specialists in this field refer to as ""problem drug users.""From the pile of papers on his desk, Goulão unearths a copy of a speech he recently gave in Paris. Flipping through it, he finds the figure he's looking for: 100,000. This is the number of severely drug-addicted people in Portugal at the height of the epidemic, in the mid-1990s. Portugal's total population at the time was just under 10 million. The number of drug addicts who became infected with HIV was also considerably higher than in most other countries.A drug slum formed in Lisbon, at the edge of a neighborhood known as Casal Ventoso. Here junkies slept in shacks or in the garbage, in extremely poor conditions. ""They shot up on the street, and they died on the street,"" Goulão says. Anyone in Portugal could observe this phenomenon -- on TV, in newspaper pictures or even from the nearby highway.These were the conditions in the country at the point when the Portuguese government convened an anti-drug commission composed of 11 experts, including Goulão. Most of the members of the commission were not politicians.""Drug users aren't criminals, they're sick,"" Goulão says. Not everyone agrees -- Pinto Coelho, for example. But the anti-drug commission quickly agreed on this position, which formed the basis for Portugal's experiment in dealing with drug users without dealing in deterrents. Goulão repeats that statement often, as do members of his staff within the anti-drug program, as well as doctors at state-run drug clinics. More surprising is that a Lisbon police commissioner, whose officers spend their days searching for drugs, says it too.The logical extension of this statement is that people who are not criminals should not be treated as criminals. They should not be arrested, put on trial or thrown in jail. The punishment for drug possession in Portugal prior to decriminalization was up to a year in prison.The Portuguese experiment has been in action since Law 30/2000 went into effect nearly 12 years ago, and Goulão's staff is currently calculating how much money the country's judicial system has saved, in its courts and prisons, now that it no longer has to process individuals the police catch with a few grams of drugs.""The police still search people for drugs,"" Goulão points out. Hashish, cocaine, ecstasy -- Portuguese police still seize and destroy all these substances.Before doing so, though, they first weigh the drugs and consult the official table with the list of 10-day limits. Anyone possessing drugs in excess of these amounts is treated as a dealer and charged in court. Anyone with less than the limit is told to report to a body known as a ""warning commission on drug addiction"" within the next 72 hours.The Second Time Brings ConsequencesIn Lisbon, for example, the local drug addiction commission is housed on the first floor of an unremarkable office building. The idea is that no one should feel uncomfortable about being seen here. A 19-year-old in a white polo shirt waits in one room. Police caught him over the weekend with about a gram of hashish. A social worker has already questioned him for half an hour and learned that he attended vocational training at an agricultural school, lives with his parents and smokes pot now and then. This was the first time he was caught in possession of drugs.""Social user, no risk factors present,"" the social worker notes.Next, a psychologist and a lawyer speak to the young man. They want to know if he's aware of the dangers of cannabis.""Yeah, yeah, from school,"" he says. ""We had a class on prevention.""As long as he isn't caught again within the next three months, his case will be closed. ""We won't inform anyone that you were here and this won't go on your record,"" the lawyer explains. ""But if it happens a second time, there are serious consequences.""But later, asked to explain these consequences in more detail, nothing comes to her mind that sounds particularly serious. A couple days of community service, perhaps. The commission can also impose fines, but the lawyer says it doesn't like to do so for teenagers. The fines are likewise not intended for people the commission determines to be addicts -- they're already paying to maintain their habit. ""Our most important duty is to invite people to participate in rehab,"" she explains. Lisbon police send around 1,500 people to the commission each year, which averages out to less than five a day. Seventy percent of these cases concern marijuana. Those who fail to turn up receive a couple of reminders, but coercion is not an intended part of this system.Decriminalization, Not LegalizationWarnings, reminders and invitations to rehab -- it seems Portugal's war on drugs is a gentle one. ""Humanistic and pragmatic"" is how João Goulão describes the new program. It is based on decriminalization, which should not be confused with legalization. Portugal considered that path too, but ultimately decided not to take things quite that far.When Portugal's parliament was debating the proposed Law 30/2000, representatives of right-wing parties declared that planes would start arriving in the country daily, full of people looking for an easy opportunity to pump themselves full of drugs. Our entire country will become a drug-ridden slum, these parties said. The left-wing parties in parliament held a majority, though.Goulão sits in his office and pages through charts, tables and graphs that are just some of the great quantity of data his team has collected over the years.The data show, among other things, that the number of adults in Portugal who have at some point taken illegal drugs is rising. At the same time, though, the number of teenagers who have at some point taken illegal drugs is falling. The number of drug addicts who have undergone rehab has also increased dramatically, while the number of drug addicts who have become infected with HIV has fallen significantly. What, though, do these numbers mean? With what exactly can they be compared? There isn't a great deal of data from before the experiment began. And, for example, the number of adults who have tried illegal drugs at some point in their lives is increasing in most other countries throughout Europe as well.Running Out of Money""We haven't found some miracle cure,"" Goulão says. Still, taking stock after nearly 12 years, his conclusion is, ""Decriminalization hasn't made the problem worse.""At the moment, Goulão's greatest concern is the Portuguese government's austerity policies in the wake of the euro crisis. Decriminalization is pointless, he says, without being accompanied by prevention programs, drug clinics and social work conducted directly on the streets. Before the euro crisis, Portugal spent 75 million ($98 million) annually on its anti-drug programs. So far, Goulão has only seen a couple million cut from his programs, but if the crisis in the country grows worse, at some point there may no longer be enough money.It is simply by chance that the European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) has its headquarters in Lisbon. Frank Zobel works here, analyzing various approaches to combating drugs, and he says he can observe ""the greatest innovation in this field"" right outside his office door.No drug policy, Zobel says, can genuinely prevent people from taking drugs -- at least, he is not familiar with any model that works this way. As for Portugal, Zobel says, ""This is working. Drug consumption has not increased severely. There is no mass chaos. For me as an evaluator, that's a very good outcome."""

They are two ways a significant change in law can be achieved: in an ideal world, ruled by enlightened people, those in charge would show society the way further, in real world no politician will ever take a decision without a strong grassroot support, because politics is their full time job, and they won't run the risk of losing it or slow their career down.   So changes come when those in charge realize public opinion is ready for it or, second possibility: when a law is so obviously inapplicable that trying to enforce it is a waste of time and money. That's what I think is bound to happen with the prohibition of cannabis, and DNM will help making this happen.  The two mains things that make CR so special are that firstly, it's a market dedicated to cannabis only, which gives it all the more credibility as a tool to render prohibitive laws obsolete (I DO think all drugs should be legal, but I also believe things should be taken one step at a time) the second one is related to the first in that people here are not addicts wasting their lives away, our lives do not revolve solely around weed and hash:   I for one have tons of other interests, this fight is not one I'm ready to die for, I just think it's a step in the logical evolution of modern society and once this step is taken there will come another one and another one after that.  And I'm just talking about recreational use here, refusing medical use to people who do feel better thanks to this particular plant is just plain outrageous.   Long Live CR! Changing the world is a huge task but making it a little bit better is already a great achievement.","angry face!  angry face!    ... It shouldn't be political!...

Seems like mj didn't damage your brain as much as it's supposed to. Or did they lie to us about that too?      This actually sounds very familiar, I've tried a lot of drugs for that exact reason, I don't regret most of these experiences mind you, but maybe , just maybe, if I had been told while still a teenager that no drug was bad in itself but could eventually lead to dangerous behaviours, I wouldn't have questioned so many things and wanted to see it all for myself.  I think you've touched a very sensitive and important point there. Just how many kids have had that feeling and thus played with their physical and mental health? Each and every teenager questions adults rules and points of view, so when you lie to them so blatantly, they will eventually find out and once they go down that way, they're basically left to decide for themselves how far they will follow it. Some will be clever and lucky enough to know their limits, other won't, be it because their personality isn't strong enough yet or just because they have a natural tendency towards addictive and hazardous behaviors.  Another point I'd add is that when you're that age, anything forbidden is extremely tempting and exciting. This might explain why once legalization has been implemented:   P.S. : I knew from the start this was not just another DNM, THIS IS POLITICAL!   ","The government has no place telling me, or anyone else, what they are allowed to do with THEIR OWN BODY.Period. Bottom line. If you have to continue arguing for legalization after that point you are probably arguing with someone so deep in the kool-aid they will never be coming back (the metaphorical chess-shitting pigeon). If in doubt, ask someone this question: ""Should the government be allowed to take organs from people? Say there is a 7 year old girl who really needs a kidney and the government decides she needs a kidney more than you need two kidneys. Is it OK for the government to forcibly take your kidney from you under threat of imprisonment?"" If they answer that they would ""of course,"" give the girl a kidney, just keep playing with the variables until they start to understand the full picture. ""What if she was 12 instead of 7?"" ""What if it was a 22 year old male police officer who needed a kidney?"" ""What if it was a politician?"" ""What government agency would end up responsible for making the decisions of who gets to keep their kidneys and who doesn't, and do you think they would do a good job?"" Etc....if they don't end up seeing the problem just take my advice and call it a day.;My thoughts on Marijuana as a gate-way drug is that the issue is not just that dealers have it as well as hard drugs. I think this isn't even the case most of the time, most street level weed dealers are pretty strictly weed. I think Marijuana is a ""gateway drug"" because they CLASS mj in the same category as all the other hardest/most dangerous drugs, and then everyone quickly finds out they were lied to and MJ is actually incredibly safe. After one finds that information out, questions like this occur: ""what else were they lying to me about? If they told me weed was this terrible horrible stuff and I find out it's amazing, maybe the same is true for heroin."" And there you go. All of a sudden this child you have LIED TO for years on end is now questioning everything they have learned regarding drug education and made your entire fucking program worthless.;Studies have shown that minor consumption actually goes downclearnet: http://justsaynow.firedoglake.com/2014/07/30/study-indicates-medical-marijuana-legalization-doesnt-increase-use-by-teenagers"

One that's valid for dealers of any type of drugs. So my next question :What about legalizing all drugs? I read somewhere addiction should be considered as a disease and treated as such. I think legalizing all drugs would be a good way to get to know and help all users who do have an addiction problem.   I know there's something that feels wrong with the idea of making drugs like H or Crystal Meth legal. But the point is to eventually help people in need. What's your view on this one?,"Another thing that may help in convos:Dealers do not want legalization because they would lose their customerbase. When the ""enemy"" or ""bad guy"" is on the same side as you, you may want to rethink your stance on the subject"

I sometimes have the feeling each side are constantly repeating the same things,  pros: not more (less) dangerous than alcohol and tobacco,         natural product         medical purpose          not as addictive as other drugs         if legal, will be taxed so more income for states/countries  Cons: gateway drug          easier access for kids included if legalized          dangerous product can cause depression, loss of identity, nuclear war, tsunamis, earthquakes and red eyes.  I think it's about times both sides found new ideas.  What do you suggest? Anyone with a new angle on this, I could use next time the subject pops in the conversation and I want to help people see things differently?  I know debating legalization with some people is like playing chess with a pigeon* but I like birds!  *now matter how good you are the pigeon will always end up walking on the board and shitting all over it.*                     ",

I spoke with him several times and he was very professional to work with.  Stealth was fine.  Used standard precautions.  Product is so small it is very easy to conceal and ship.  Filled my new Kanger Aero Mini with dual coil atomizer with the entire amount.  Let it wick in good for a bit.  It is not as liquid as ecig juice but not as thick as full on concentrate or oil.  The flavor is pleasurable.  Kind of a lemon flavor.  Not sure if this was added or if this was the flavor of the additives to make the oil viscious enough for this purpose.  I didn't mind it however there was no marijuana flavor or taste unfortunately but I am sure that is the tradeoff for making something for this purpose.  It took me more hits to get where I wanted to be compared to vaping wax in a pen but again that is because it is not as concentrated.  The convenience of not having to fill it each time I want to use it and the convience of being able to take lots of drags is excellent.  I have taken a bunch and can't tell it dropping in volume yet.  I am unsure of how many hits 1ML will get you approximately.  The product was packaged and sealed very well.  Overall I really like the stealth and convenience factor.  You could probably walk right past a cop or security at a concert and everyone would think this was an ecig since it is!   I'd say if anyone is on the fence about trying this product don't be.    I REALLY like that the price has dropped I think this is a better value at the new price!  I would highly recommend going straight for the 3ML vial and pass on the 1ML vial.  ,

Many of the terpines are removed in our purification process, but we do find that flavor is slightly different with every run. What you taste is a combination of the natural oil flavor and the flavor of PG. If you have ever vaped pure PG you'll know which flavors are which.  We will shortly be launching a product called STEALTH - it is a less intimidating 300mg version (300mg of cannabinoids per 1ml rather than the stronger 400mg) with a slight additive flavor of butterscotch cookie. With this additive flavor you'll find that the liquid much more closely resembles normal eliquid with a lighter appearance and modified fragrance.  We also recommend the 3ml bottles, it is a better price and will keep a person fully stocked for much much longer.",I dediced to give this product a try and purchased some from tzzht!I spoke with him several times and he was very professional to work with.Stealth was fine.  Used standard precautions.  Product is so small it is very easy to conceal and ship.Filled my new Kanger Aero Mini with dual coil atomizer with the entire amount.  Let it wick in good for a bit.  It is not as liquid as ecig juice but not as thick as full on concentrate or oil.The flavor is pleasurable.  Kind of a lemon flavor.  Not sure if this was added or if this was the flavor of the additives to make the oil viscious enough for this purpose.  I didn't mind it however there was no marijuana flavor or taste unfortunately but I am sure that is the tradeoff for making something for this purpose.It took me more hits to get where I wanted to be compared to vaping wax in a pen but again that is because it is not as concentrated.  The convenience of not having to fill it each time I want to use it and the convience of being able to take lots of drags is excellent.  I have taken a bunch and can't tell it dropping in volume yet.  I am unsure of how many hits 1ML will get you approximately.The product was packaged and sealed very well.Overall I really like the stealth and convenience factor.  You could probably walk right past a cop or security at a concert and everyone would think this was an ecig since it is!   I'd say if anyone is on the fence about trying this product don't be.  I REALLY like that the price has dropped I think this is a better value at the new price!  I would highly recommend going straight for the 3ML vial and pass on the 1ML vial.

I thought it would be easy to make when I started 2 years ago, but quickly realized that even when using concentrates the perfect product that would go into something that looks like a blu or njoy ecigarette was not as simple as I had hoped. The value is in the flexibility of the product.  We price our product to compete directly with o.pen. $70 for 400mg of cannabinoids if you buy it at 1ml, or $66/400mg if you buy 3ml for $200.   I have a few cartridges that I have left on a shelf filled with 1ml of the liquid. I cannot detect any separation after over a month. It is possible that it will never separate, time will tell. Compared to other liquids I have seen from CA dispensaries separation usually occurs within 1-2 weeks. The only way to keep those going is to shake them up or expose them to heat, etc. Some oxidation will occur (darkening of the liquid) and I do not recommend leaving it out in the open for months at a time. That's just something you don't want to do with cannabis in general.  I have used the liquid in kanger protank 2 mini and kanger aero mini and it is amazing in either.","Quote from: tzzht on July 19, 2014, 05:56:38 pmQuote from: tech2014alpha on July 16, 2014, 07:40:39 pmI was also interested in this product however it takes about 7 grams of high quality MJ to make 1.5 grams/1.5ML of concetrate which you probably dilute 1:1 or 70:30 with concentrate and your EJMIX type solution of PEG/PG/VG to come up with the 3ML.I takes all of 15 minutes to take shatter or wax and make your own ecig oil with concentrate with the proper mixing agents.  Hard to justify paying $200 for what amounts of 7 grams of weed.  I understand your out to make money and this is your own proprietary recipe but still....  $$$Feel free to correct me if I am mistaken.  I wish you all the best here and glad to see new vendors popping up!There are definitely chemists out there who are capable of making this product properly.

Let's talk about why it's so difficult to produce evidence regarding cannabis. You might be surprised to find out, it's mostly related to  politics.   In the United States, cannabis is classified as a  schedule 1 drug.  According to the DEA [1], a schedule 1 drug is;   According to Nature [2] (research journal);   According to the research I have seen, in order to do research in the United States on these substances requires approval from close to 12 different agencies, several of them federal.  The second hardest part is that research is expensive, costing millions of dollars. The majority of funding for research comes from pharmaceutical companies and the government.   So even if you can get approved for the study itself, you also need to get approved for  funding of the research.  This makes doing studies on cannabis extremely difficult, and as mentioned above, almost impossible.   Several Congressman in the United States has pushed the federal government to remove cannabis from Schedule 1 status to allow for more research, but the federal government has not even budged on the matter, making doing research within the United States on cannabis, nearly impossible, leaving other, poorer countries to be the front runners on this research.  Unfortunately, according to Scientific American [3];      Sources: [1]  http://www.justice.gov/dea/druginfo/ds.shtml [2]  http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v14/n8/full/nrn3530.html [3]  http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/end-the-ban-on-psychoactive-drug-research/","Schedule I drugs, substances, or chemicals are defined as drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. Schedule I drugs are the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence. Some examples of Schedule I drugs are:heroin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), marijuana (cannabis), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy), methaqualone, and peyote ;An important and unfortunate outcome of the controls placed on these and other psychoactive drugs is that they make research into their mechanisms of action and potential therapeutic uses  for example, in depression and post-traumatic stress disorder  difficult and in many cases almost impossible.;Three United Nations treaties extend similar restrictions to much of the rest of the world."

Iran right now appears to be blocking the IP addresses of the Tor entry nodes, so there are two options.  #1) Have people host private bridges that are not known to the public, preferrably obfuscated 3 bridges which disguise the traffic completely into randomized traffic.   #2) Flash proxies which are a type of pluggable transport that rotates IP addresses every 5 minutes and thus virtually impossible to block, the downside is that the traffic itself is not obfuscated, so deep packet inspection could still technically analyze the traffic, but I don't know if Iran is this technically advanced yet compared to China.","Quote from: Weedijuana on August 09, 2014, 11:59:21 amTor is a distinct protocol, it is extremely easy to block.Obfuscated bridges attempt to mitigate this though.Iran is nuts though, I remember a few years back when they banned all ssl encrypted traffic.Is there a way to make a private communications protocol that is very difficult to detect/block, in whatever country, so, not necessarily legal everywhere, but not really illegal either - just private and really hard to find?

In the last week, the state-owned Telecommunications Company of Iran has effectively knocked off 75 percent of all Tor traffic in the country.  Tor, an anonymity tool used by millions of people around the world for a wide variety of purposes, is a powerful and popular tool used in Iran used by political activists and citizens looking to get around the countrys strict speech and press laws.  Normally, as many as 40,000 Iranians are using Tor at any given moment. Today, that number has dropped to 10,000 and falling.  Tor, which until recently worked easily with a simple download in Iran, has a long history of battling for anonymity inside of Persia. The software was used effectively and widely during protests in 2009. The government began rolling out a new state-of-the-art Internet censorship system in 2011 in an attempt to build a Halal Internet. Since then, the government has gone after Tors promise of anonymity and, consequently, freedom from Irans rules in a variety of ways. Combined, Irans censorship tools have been labelled the Great Persian Firewall, a nod to Chinas similar system of online suppression.  In 2011, Tor and Iran engaged in an arms race, as the government would find a new methods of blocking and Tors developers would build new circumvention toolssometimes even releasing them on the same day the governments censors built their blocks.  That arms race with Iran, and other censorship regimes around the globe, continues to this day.  Irans latest move attempts to block all of the Tor network relays publicly listed by the Tor Project, is not absolute. It takes several more steps to to circumvent Irans action. But it is possible.  Iranians can attempt to access Bridgessecret and unlisted Tor relays designed to circumvent censorship that are much more difficult to blockas a hidden path onto the Tor network. Another option for bridges is to email  bridges@torproject.org from either Riseup.net, Gmail or Yahoo, a rule set in place to avoid fake emails being sent.  Users outside of Iran can run a Tor bridge to help circumvent the censorship. We outlined how to run a Tor bridge several months ago when it was the Turkish government trying and failing to block Tor.   Clearnet Source  ",

It's just joints for me, gotta roll them to smoke smooth, and sometimes, especially with fatter Js, I actually need more than one paper to keep a tight clean burn. Inhaling the smoke directly feels good, and I like it that way.   Sometimes the real good Ganja is just too sticky to roll and smoke that way, so I did buy a little pipe to see if it would smoke any better. After burning my fingers, I use a nifty little Colibri torch that I bought years ago in New York City, I never could get a good puff - I threw the thing away after the first try (not all $15 experiments work out).   Now, I do a little of my own air drying for the real sticky stuff, and for roach weed (I love recycling, weed that is). First time I did this by mistake (I had no idea 4-5 hours of outside air would dry it so much), and got real worried I had ruined a great batch.

Have tried suckers and some other homemade concoctions too, but nope. Haven't tried CheebaChews yet though. Really, the ONLY reason that I stay away from commercial edibles is because they are SO FUCKING EXPENSIVE on the Darknet. $30+$8 to ship, so $40 by the time you're all said and done. I am not near a medical state, so not sure what retail is on them. And are edibles only available to medical card holders? Hell, i dunno.

From the various reports I have read regarding the effects of smoking vs. vaping; they're sort of different.  Obviously, when vaping you are heating your material just enough to combust a few of the actives (THC, CBD), whereas with combustion you are combusting the matter entirely.  I still cough a bit with vaping, but not nearly as bad as when I inhaled smoke.  If I get brave enough eventually, I'd try both methods (smoke/vape) on two different nights; maybe after a bit of a break just to be sure and write a comparative analysis.  I just don't like the idea of inhaling smoke even if it is ""healthier,"" then inhaling tobacco/god knows what else.  ",

Do you recommend any product over another?,Cannabis Road Discussion/General Discussion," Thanks dude.  I tried half heartedly a while ago with about 1g low/mid grade preground sample from a new vendor and some OTC rubbing alcohol (70% stuff).  I don't think it turned out too well.  The evaporation took forever because of the high water content which caused the plant matter to start breaking down and a slightly funky 'wet' smell.  Sort of like an old washcloth that was sat around wet for a while.  The plant matter caused the residue to be green brown, almost like a hash.  I mixed that with maybe an ounce combined of both PG and VG and have let it sit for about 2 months (occassional shaking).  It'll vape in my mechanical mod (smok magnetic switch/battery and an IGO W3 with only 2 coils and cotton wick) but it is pretty weak and I barely get any high out of it.  I do taste the weed and it tastes OK despite the smells when I did my version of the slow ISO extraction..but no or barely any high.   I've even tried a good few dropper fulls under the tongue and don't get much that way either.  Lessons learned are use higher grade ISO and i need more than 1g of low/mids to make ejuice.  ISO supposedly removes the THC fairly quickly - like 5-15 minutes.  Any longer and you're breaking down plant matter.  Mine took 3 days of sitting in front of a fan at normal room temp.  I've found a very interesting link on one of the clearnet MJ sites from someone who seems very knowledgeable about making juices.

I'll roll up a medium sized joint and get two sessions out of it if I'm on my own.  You definitely get better taste vaping, that's for sure, but the high I get from a J is just too great to pass up.  And bowls burn my throat and don't get me very high unless I totally cash out and then my throat hurts the whole time I'm high so it really cuts the buzz.  I think its partially the butane that I suck down with the bowl that hurts the throat but its mostly just the heat probably.  So its joints for the foreseeable future, but I'm always into trying something new.  I used the Volcano vape once with a friend and it got me really quite high.  All the vapor in that bag was a really efficient way to get wrecked.  But $600, damn.  I saw a documentary on legalization in Montana (that's a fucked up story), and there was this cute old grandma using the Volcano for her cancer pain.  Fan-frickin-tastic.   Until they Feds dropped the hammer and now she's back on fucking opiates which she hates.  Damn I hate the fucking feds.  Anyhow, on the joint front, I have used coconut flavored papers before and they were really nice.  I used them with some of our spicy-citrus sativa Kali Mist and the taste was just phenomenal.  Yummmmm.",

Personally, I've never been one to combust much of anything.  I find it fairly harsh for my virgin lungs and throat.  True smoking out of a pipe, bong, or joint  is my last resort.  However I really do like the full ""hit by a train"" high that combustion gives.  I have made my own edibles before.  Dosing with homemade edibles when you don't know what the heck you are doing ends up being quite hard because of the lack of consistent product.  One brownie might knock you off of your ass for 8 hours while the next might not do anything.  The hour delay in feeling effects makes this very hard to judge if you need more.  I primarily use vaporization and I have 2 vaporizers in my stable.  The vapolution 2.0 is my desktop unit and the hammer is my portable.    The vapolution is quite ugly in my book, but is a great valued performer with an all glass path if you use their AIW bowl.   They will be releasing the vapolution 3.0 sometime later this year and supposedly it will look and perform even better and will have a bigger bowl/heater and digital temp control. The hammer is a butane powered vape.  It takes some getting used to and sometimes they arrive not fully optimized/adjusted(my case).  Once you take the time to learn it is a heavy hitter too.  Not very stealthy though ...

Your Magar will be custom made to order using the same method, and starting with 7g of my top shelf buds. Expect total weight of the Magar to be between 6 and 6.8g.  The exterior is a lightweight sheet (0.017g) of thinly pressed organic hemp.  Measures about 5"" long and 3/4"" in diameter.  This is a special product that will be custom made for your order, so strain selections and blends are all up to you. BHO can be added for an extra kick, strains can be ""layered"" (for example, magar begins with one strain and finishes with another, literally 50/50 split), and the magar can even be flavored at your request. I have some sheets of organic hemp paper that have been cured in the following extracts: tangerine, lime, lemon, pine, lavender, and citrus blend. This can be a subtle but pleasant addition to the flavor profile.  If you order a large number of Magars at once, there may be additional processing time for that portion of your order. Contact me in advance for estimates.

That out of the way, for your last question: is it safe to order again?   You know the answer already. It is significantly less safe, but will ease back towards being safer over time.  Personally I wouldn't go tempting fate (or LE), with, for example, the possibilities of two interceptions to the same address in a short period of time. Whereas one package can go and just get a letter, multiple may be a different story, especially if you decide to order larger amounts or other substances.   If for some reason I can't understand you really really want to use that address again, I would first order a LOT of packages from individual sellers on ebay and amazon. Not stuff ""shipped and sold by amazon"" either, get the stuff from the small time shops with weird names. These guys are going to have all kinds of crazy packaging, weird labels, boxes, etc. If, and this is a big if honestly but it pays to be careful, any inspectors are checking out your mail, this flood of stuff is going to have fairly predictable results.   They will search until they get tired of opening your mail for seemingly no reason and move you down the list of priorities. Now, 6 months later, it's not out of the realm of possibility to have some inspector randomly decide to check a package again, but depending on what/how much you got intercepted, also determines the risk.  summary: don't do it. go get a po box or something, it's worth the money to not worry about another interception/potentially other trouble.

According to police there are several names for the drug including Honeycomb, Butter and Wax.  It can be carried around in a bag, hidden in plain sight basically, said Roswell Police Officer Zachary Frommer.  The drug is made from the oils of marijuana plants and has a very high concentration of THC.  Joints you'd smoke could equal a dose of the wax, said Frommer.  Roswell Police discovered 80 grams of Wax during a major drug bust at a home.  Roswell Police say they believe the people arrested in the drug bust were likely selling to high school kids because it's easy to transport and hide. They have received complaints from parents at Roswell High School.  Police say Wax is easy to transport and easy to conceal. The drug has the consistency of wax and can be molded into various shapes or simply tiny, round balls. It is often found hidden in jars of lip balm, because it is basically the same color and texture.",

Always use a new CR wallet address for every deposit.  Never use them twice.  That's why it tells you how much BTC it has recieved per wallet. Don't delete them though until transactions are fully processed.  Also when you transfer BTC from your legit coinbase to your blockchain account always use a new blockchain account on TOR.  Process:  1.  Buy BTC on coinbase on legit ISP connection as yourself, don't use VPN, TOR, etc. 2.  Log on to VPN+TOR and create a blockchain account anonymously.  Don't even tell it an email address. 3.  Transfer BTC from coinbase to anonymously tor created blockchain account. 4.  Then transfer from anonymously created tor blockchain account to bitcoin fog or just shared send it to your CR wallet.  I think as long as you transferred from coinbase to anonymously created TOR blockchain address and then shared send it over to CR you are probably covered well enough.  If you were a seller I'd say take more precautions.  Oh and use Tails.  Keep it up to date. Have 2 USB keys.  Make a backup file using USB key backup utility and restore it to the 2nd key every time you make persistent changes.  Keep the two keys in seperate physical locations so you cannot lose both at once.     I personally use VPN service on top of windows running tails in a VM.  My ISP cannot see that I am using TOR/Tails then and I am anonymous on TOR.",

With Multisig Escrow, we truly believe we will grow and blossom and eventually play with the bigboys. In the meantime, we would like to perform a few security upgrades, and with sales being slow, we are still yet to raise enough to do so.  As the hair on the back of our necks stands from the looming eyes of the LE, we reach out to you, many successful vendors from a different market, and ask you for monetary help.  We didn't charge vendor bond in hopes it would result in more vendors quicker, which would attract more customers. While we stand by our decision to do this, hopefully some of the more successful vendors can help us out. We need to raise a total of $3000. We are sending this message to all vendors on site. We hope that if everyone sends a small portion, we can raise this goal, and we can roll out the proper security penetration tests after the heartbleed problem. We are confident we are more than secure, but it never hurts to be paranoid, and we are being just that.  If you are willing and able to help, please donate to 1EaXWe4cY2pbtm9b83k8asQkJ82CXmLF6i  This address has been generated specifically for the donations from our lovely vendors. After you send your donation, please send a PM with the total that you sent and we will verify it. After the sales on the site pick up, we will wait until we have sufficient money back from the fees on sales, and we will send payments back to all vendors who donated in one lump sum. After we repay, you will receive a star next to your name to let people know you were here from the start.  With your help, we will stay vigilant through any scrutiny by police or the feds.

Official JackBlue vendor review thread,Vendors/Official Vendor Review Threads," ---------------------------------------Jack Blue's Girls of Summer 2014--------------------------------------- Ok we're finally just a few days away from puttling up listings for the summer 2014 crop from JackBlue.  If you're interested in checking out our products, you need to read this entire post for important information.   -----------------Stealth Mode----------------- Some of you may have noticed that my profile page was missing for a couple of days recently.  Actually the page was there but hidden.  Anyone from SR 1.0 may remember stealth mode?  For those who don't know, stealth mode is a way for vendors to operate in a semi-private or fully private market within CR.  Vendors in stealth mode won't show up in a search of the site, and neither will their products.  The only way to see the listings and place orders is through a special stealth profile page link.  Why are we doing this?  We're not trying to be super exclusive.  It's just that we are in the fortunate position where demand for our products always seems to outpace supply.  We're thrilled to have so many enthusiastic customers.  You guys are all great and we really appreciate you.  But it's easy to get overwhelmed with orders and messages when you're on a public market, and it just got to be too much on SR 1.0 before we turned on stealth mode.   Moving to stealth mode helped us to preserve our sanity and made it possible to continue giving great customer service to our loyal customers.    Don't worry, there aren't any qualifications needed to get access to our stealth page and prouduct listings.  In fact if you bought products from us previously or sent us a message on the market message system, then you're already on our message list and will be receiving a link within the next couple of days.    If you are a fan, the link to the JackBlue profile page that is on the left side of your home screen will continue to work whether or not stealth mode is activated.  From now until the listings go up in a day or so, I will turn off stealth mode so if you're not yet a fan you can add me to your favorites so you'll have the link.  Or you can message me and ask to be added to my message list and I'll send you the link.   ------------------------Products and Pricing-------------------------  The first listings going up this week will be some amber shatter concentrate, and buds will include XJ-13 (G13 X Jack Herer), Black Jack (Black Domina X Jack Herer) and Fire OG.  In about a week and a half, Blue Dream and Girl Scout Cookies listings will go up.  I plan to list 1/8 oz, 1/4 oz, 1/2 oz and 1 ounce of each strain.  Depending on how fast orders are coming in, we may decide to switch the product mix to smaller weight sizes and eliminate 1 oz listings so supplies will last longer and more buyers will be able to get at least some of their first choice strain.  I'd strongly suggest if there's a strain that you want, but you don't see the size listed that you want, that you buy what's available.  If only 1/8, 1/4 and 1/2 GSC is available in listings, messaging us to ask about 1 oz sizes is probably a bad idea.  By the time we get a chance to read and respond to your message, it's very possible that the strain will sell out.  We suggest that you hold off on requests for custom  listings until after the first listiings have been up for at least 7 days.   Pricing:  XJ-13, Black Jack, Blue Dream, Fire OG     1/8 oz $50, 1/4 oz $80, 1/2 oz $150, 1 oz $280 Girl Scout Cookies (Thin Mint Cut)            1/8 oz $55, 1/4 oz $90, 1/2 oz $160, 1 oz $300 Amber Shatter                                       1 gr. $50, 1/8 oz $160    ---------------------------Multi-Signature Escrow---------------------------  If you haven't used mult-sig escrow before, you might want to read the tutorials in the forum before placing an order.  We only use multi-sig escrow.  With multi-signature escrow, there is no way for a hacker or rogue market staff member to steal escrow funds.  Everyone should be using mult-sig escrow after seeing some of the recent scams.  Take the time to become familiar with the concepts.  Jack will help you if you have any questions or problems.  It's really pretty easy once you get started.  If you have any questions feel free to send me a message on the market.  I check the forum for messages less often.  Be patient, this is our busiest time but we promise we'll reply to your messages as soon as we can.  All the best,   Jack",

XJ-13 (G13 x Jack Herer) Girsl Scout Cookies (three different phenotypes of GSC in search for best of the best) Fire OG Dream Queen (Blue Dream x Space Queen)  so the good news is that new JackBlue listings are just a few short weeks away.   The bad news is that with summer here, i expect that good indoor bud is becoming scarce so i fully expect to sell out of this crop in record time.  I know, I know.  I wish it wasnt true but what can i say?So if you want to get some of this crop i suggest you get your bitcoins ready and keep your eyes open for the listings.  I''ll post another message here a couple of days  before the listings go up.  Does anyone know a good Tor photo hosting server?  I have some bud porn from this grow.  If i find a secure photo hosting site I'll post links to the pics here in my review thread.  Stay tuned for Jack's Girls of Summer 2014!  JackBlue Skyfarm Collective, CA USA   ",

Official JackBlue vendor review thread,Vendors/Official Vendor Review Threads,"So instead of trying JackBlue's product and immediately writing a review, I decided to give it a month of regular usage before exporting my thoughts to paper (so to speak). My hope is this approach will provide for the reader a more accurate analysis of the product, assuming periodic usage over the duration of a month.    JB Special  Upon inhalation, the supreme quality of the bud was immediately apparent. I was steamrolled with an incredible sense of euphoria equitable with that experienced during my best childhood memories. The contrast between colors became more apparent than normal. More importantly, my mind wasn't busying itself with thoughts. Instead, I was able to take in the wonders of nature through a filter unobstructed by excessive internal narration. I decided to listen to Miles Davis's Milestones, and despite having listened to the album hundreds of times, new sounds were made apparent. Hopefully you're now getting a better sense as to how good this ganja is.   After about a week of regular usage (about 2 joints a day), the potency of the high began to diminish. But let's be reasonable: this is attributed to the natural limitations put into place by our biology and is no reflection of the quality of the product. Hell, even the diminished high was excellent :-)   I've made sure to set aside a copious amount for friends and family to try when they're visiting. Sharing the JB Special with those close is something that's mandatory, as it'd be a travesty to keep all this goodness to myself.    Taste This is JackBlue we are talking about here. The taste was magnificent, and the smoke was free from the typical harshness experienced while partaking in other sellers products.    Stealth Immaculately packaged. I''ll leave it at that.    Shipping Received my package within a few days of placing my order. To improve on shipping would mean someone delivers to your door the day you purchase, which is quite unreasonable.    In Closing Why are you still reading?! Go do yourself a favor and order from JackBlue!! ",

Official JackBlue vendor review thread,Vendors/Official Vendor Review Threads,"Even though I haven't bought off JackBlue on Cannabis Road yet I had to come here and give him my love and support. Jack has been my exclusive weed and concentrate vendor ever since SR went down and I couldn't be more pleased. We've developed a bond over the last year and he's honestly a friend first and my dealer second.   I'm not going to come here and tell you that Jack's weed is the dankest or that his concentrates are the purest and strongest. What I am going to tell you is that I've done business with all the top vendors from SilkRoad and I have no reason to go anywhere else. Sure, I might shop with other vendor at times for variety, but at the end of the day I will always come back to Jack if I want the best service and products.  He really is in another league. Everyone loves his bud but personally I love his concentrates. He makes them himself, usually (always?) using pure bud material (no trim) and they are so flavorful and potent that I've no joke hallucinated off them before. My vision felt warped and it was almost like a psychedelic trip. He makes it from his gorgeous buds which are grown to perfection themselves so I can only imagine what the THC content is in his concentrates. Here's some pics I took a few weeks ago of bud that I got from him:   http://imgur.com/a/B2DWs  I'm going to try and dig up some of my older reviews and pictures of Jack stuff too and post it over here later.  Thanks Jack, for everything. Love you lots and wishing you the best on CR.  Your one and only,  HEATFan",

Official JackBlue vendor review thread,Vendors/Official Vendor Review Threads,"First I want to congratulate ECC and Crypto on the opening of their new market.  Obviously a ton of work went into putting CR together and i want to wish them the best of luck.  So far i've been thoroughly impressed with the professionalism of the team running the market.  My guess is they are getting tired of all my requests for little tweaks here and there and added features. But despite working around the clock preparing for the site launch they have never provided anything less than top notch customer service. My hat is off to you ECC and Crypto.  Congrats on a great launch!  Some of you may know me from SR 1.0.  I took a break and lay low for a while until ECC talked me into joining his market as a launch vendor.  For those of you who don't know me, I'm Jack.  I've been growing indoor Hydro and aeroponic bud here in the stunning coastal range of northern CA for 18 years now (yeah I know I'm old don't remind me lol).  In dog  years I'd be ... Never mind I don't they have numbers that big EG   By California standards I have a relatively small grow operation and that suits me just fine.  I don't consider myself part of the medical industrial cannabis machine that's taken over much of CA.  I think when you get too big in this biz, quality is the first thing to go.  I personally manage all the growing, and nothing ships out without my final inspection and approval.  Call me a control freak if you want, but I thinks its worked out well.  Those of you who remember me from SR days probably also remember my rabid fan base.    I love you guys!  You know who you are.  I was probably more famous for being perpetually sold out due to demand that always overwhelmed my supply.  That's probably not going to change.  I'm not a middleman or distributor and only sell what I grow and produce personally.    I'm best known for my sativa and satuva -dominant strains that I love.  I mix things up with new strains every crop as well as some old standards that I always bring back.  Occasionally I'll grow some indicaa and indica dominant hybrids, but that's more the exception.  I also produce wax and shatter.  All my concentrates are produced from 100% bud material -- no leaf trim.  You'll appreciate the difference that makes in the potency, flavor and smoothness of my wax and shatter.  finally, I really want to hear what you think.  I know your time is valuable.  I know mine is.  So I'll pay you for your reviews in bonus product on your next order. No this is not a bribe for good reviews.  You get your bonus for your honest objective review.  That's how we can keep improving.  To make sure to get your review bonus send a PM to me before you put in your order so we can flag your order.    Finally (I know I know TLDR)  my customers thanks as always for your business.  <3.  If you're not a customer yet , try us out.  If you are ever not happy with an order let me know.  Give me a chance to make it right.   at the end of the day if you're not happy i am not happy.   Cheers JackBlue",

","I'm not trying to be a reddit whore, but it looks like I am at least a bit reddit promiscuous.  Apparently there was a person who thought vending weed would be a fun job.  He researched for a whole week (yes, a WHOLE WEEK) before he setup shop on C9 marketplace since they had free vendor accounts and he didn't want to pay vendor bonds until he could determine that the business was viable..  He even took it seriously and tried to do his due diligence and asked redditors for advice, advertised the shit out of himself, and then once shop was setup on C9 he sent out low cost samples at a cost of $8ish each.  Sounds like a deal, right?Samples went out from Colorado in normal envelopes and the new vendor claimed that his stealth was totally up to par.   Cough, Cough, bullshit.  Stealth involves all aspects of the mailing.  From the inside of the package to the outside.  Dummy vendor sent out packages with no return person listed AND a fake return address which DID NOT EXIST.  Well, it turns out that CO postal authorities are on the ball and lots of packages were profiled and caught.  Many people are getting love letters and have probably burned their address for an $8 1gr sample from a new and clueless vendor.  All this happened from a new vendor on his first sample shipments.I hope no one here got caught up in this, but I know that quite a few from reddit purchase via CR.  You all have my condolences.  I wish you luck and good vibes.  May the darknet gods have mercy on your addresses.http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2aa392/seized_package/http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2aa6sj/vendor_complaint_do_not_order_from_pacificgreenery/http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2acxwv/pacificgreenery_seizure_asked_to_sign_something/I hope that this isn't a bigger profiling effort that involves CO and WA."

But back on topic, I do sometimes wonder whether our customers that order regularly don't get paranoid at all the little boxes their postal worker delivers, but then I guess those boxes are very common.  For international its a little different because our customers don't usually order as often, but its also important for vendors to change up their packaging every now and then so things don't get to predictable.  I was reading about ""caligirl"" who was busted selling xanax etc, in Texas.  He (caligirl was a guy, big surprise, and not from cali either) used the same labels, the same font, and only about 6-10 different return addresses he kept recycling.  Which is all stupid.  But the stupidest thing he did (in terms of keeping his customers safe) was to use the same damn mailbox for all of his shipments.  Oh man that's dumb.  He did even stupider stuff that got him caught, but we're talking about customer safety here.  Switching it up is the name of the game.  Never use the same labels for more than a few months, never the same font, don't reuse return addresses, and don't use the same dropbox (or zipcode for that matter) but once every few months at most.  That way the packages your customers receive have no discernible relationship to each other and won't garner as much attention.  I'm still trying to figure out how to get my hands on Amazon boxes  .",

I know this much about the postal and delivery services:  I think EMS  http://www.ems.post/ is handled by each country's national post system... for example, in the US, USPS and in Japan, JapanPost. Private sector alternatives are firms like FedEx and DHL ...  Both in my experience with just simple regular documents and parcels AND confirmed by a friend who works in security, in this region it's the private sector firms like FedEx who, in an effort to demonstrate they are in fact 'thorough', go literally overboard inspecting every single package using x-ray and physically opening up packages for inspection (even letters!). They'll even cooperate with law enforcement by allowing them to use their drivers' uniforms when making bust.   On the other hand, EMS packages arriving via JapanPost are not subject to the same rigorous inspection. While I have had similar packages opened up (evidenced by the packing tape applied after it is opened) never the same rate as it has been with FedEx or DHL.   I would be too freaked out to consider ordering anything 420 to Japan - and have too much to risk given the abnormally strict consequences. However I have known people who have done it - I was astounded when I heard it. That being said, a good way to gain an introduction to a Japanese prison cell would be to do something clearly stupid like 420 in a jar of peanut butter via FedEx - as the 100% x-ray inspection would show the differing densities right away, and there is also the issue of scent/sealing.  Having ordered Schedule IV pharmas successfully, at least one has to consider that the package they are receiving could be construed to be something wholly legitimate like any of one of many legal OTCs or vacuum packed Earl Grey etc. ",

My postman has only required 1 signature by me.  The package did not require it but for some reason he did.  It was a legit electronics item so I had no issues doing so.  Since I signed I have not had to sign for any other imported packages.  Honestly, I think he was just unfamiliar with packages that came from other countries that had customs declarations on it.  Now I don't have to sign and the postman doesn't care.   I think a good thing to do if you plan on ordering from overseas would be to make a bunch of small and cheap orders from international shippers off of sites like these clearnet sites.  Make sure you order every once in a while and try different vendors to get different packaging styles.  If you get a bunch of crazy stuff in the mail your postman becomes desensitized to strange things for you.  Heck, I even had a legit powder used for gardening come from an amazon retailer where the package was very suspicious looking with a priority mail envelope and a single ziplock baggie containing 1lb of yellow powder that leaked out during delivery.. no questions asked.   www.dealextreme.com ebay focalprice.com  www.fasttech.com ",

According to the original article the myrcene gets destroyed in the gut and is only effective as absorbed through the lining of the mouth. You might get more out of taking a single bite, chewing it up and leaving it sit in your cheek/gums than just eating the whole thing.  I just haven't had occasion to go by where my oils are but maybe I will wander out and get them tonight... I'm curious if my first impression was legit.  I will be more curious about the mangoes if your herb doesn't normally give a ""couch lock"" effect but you get it from eating mangoes. Seems like the amount you actually get is small compared to sublingual oils though.  Since I have been reading more about receptors and such, I have a way to explain what myrcene is doing. THC is a partial agonist on CB1 receptors. It is ""partial"" so there is a limit to how high you can get with THC when the CB1 receptor is saturated. I'm not sure how myrcene even does it yet (maybe it is an allosteric modulator) but it partially raises the bar and we can get more high.  Synthetic cannibinoids like JWH and stuff can be full agonists on CB1, so there is much more potential for OD and intense trips. The fact that the active compounds in a lot of traditional drugs are only partial agonists leads to them being relatively safe versus new synthetic stuff. Still, it might be worthwhile someday to consider using synthetics carefully and rather than choosing to add myrcene to get more CB1 agonism, add a partial CB1 antagonist to keep the synthetics in check. If we understand better how all this works, we could not only make natural concentrates better but also make synthetics not suck.   I got one of those a while back to check oil temp in a pan. The biggest thing holding me back is having enough herb to experiment without worry of running out.

Made an awesome batch last nite that is currently rocking my nail, along with some honey reclaim dipped in kief...  The 99% is nice because it evaps slightly faster, and maybe less additives, but tbh haven't noticed much diff between it and the 91% with regard to yield, consistency or potency.  That is more about starting material and technique, pretty much.  Someone may correct if wrong, because experience is limited.  Leave iso and cannabis in freezer for 12 hours. Probably won't get much colder... prep work area, nitrile gloves, masks recommended but optional, then work quickly! It is easier as a 2 person thing and one doing timing and support.  Do 20-30 second washes, use only enough iso to cover material. Swirl, don't shake; lately we have been using a french press and pouring the pressed iso thru another coffee filter over a jar. Any more than 3 washes is probably more trouble than it is worth. Laziness has dictated combining washes, turns out ok for home use...most pros do not recommend. If you want the break of pieces shit at room temp, leave your washes uncombined, the 1st one will get you close.  Reduce in H2O bath until about a 1/2 inch is left on bottom of jar. Then pour into clean pyrex for remaining evap. Have a fan blowing over, and if in a hurry, put pyrex pan on a griddle set @ 120 deg F.  Final product outcome is about the purge mostly I think.

If you get too gooey consistency, and darkness, you probably let too much plant matter go thru, or didn't purge well enough.    The final product should be stable enough at room temps to handle without mess, and at least translucent.   ","No problemo, I love doing stuff like this. I wish I had more money and time right now to dive into making my own concentrates but I am about to start a new job and money is tight for a while. I want to know how you get QWISO to come out more like BHO/shatter and not like the crumbly fluff. I think the tek I saw that came out like that suggested 99% ISO and more like 15sec washes with everything in a freezer for a long time, like 2-3 days.I had come across EJmix in my research and it seems very overpriced but that is to be expected with no competition. It doesn't make sense they use all 3 of 400/300/200 so that may be a bit of obfuscation on their part. The number represents an average molecular weight, so you could just use 200 and 400 if you want to end up in the 200-400 range. I'd be happy to formulate a copy of EJmix and open source it if I just had the money and time to play around with it. PEGs are known to decrease permeability with stomach lining (i.e. slow absorption) so similar might happen with inhalation."

Maybe some mycene tossed in will dank it up to the next level.  One hitter quitter vaping!     ","Quote from: PyroWolf on July 11, 2014, 05:34:22 pmI wonder about the possiblity of vaping myrcene eesential oils mixed with glycerine or pg as an alternative to eating.You mean vaping like on an ecig or putting drops of a dilute myrcene solution on bud and vaping that? Either would work I'd think. I guess interest in terpenes isn't so new and I saw one mention of putting myrcene into an alcohol tincture at a 1:125 ratio. This seems about the same as when I have worked with eucalyptol putting it in a 1% solution of PG then further diluting. The terpenes aren't so soluble in glycerine I bet, at least some of them, so you would have to limit it to maybe 20% or less in a finished blend.I've been kind of busy and have more to reply on, but am still going to be busy a while still too, will try to fit it in though and am still learning a lot. I can report a small test I did and I think it had an effect but I could have been playing tricks on myself.Since I finally got some herb, I built up a little tolerance smoking a few small bowls every night. Two nights back I hadn't smoked all day and had just been on a bike ride, decided to test and then go run errands for an hour. I took two small (~15µl) drops sublingually of blood orange essential oil and one of lime EO, then smoked a small bowl of sativa dominant herb about 10 minutes later. 10-15 minutes after that, I am pulling into the lot at the shops and noticed a bit of brightness in the lights in my rear views and around me as well as a very soft psychedelic vibe that hadn't been occurring when I normally smoked. The enhanced brightness reminded me of taking LSD with vitamin C (something I have not done for ages, nor have I done much trippy stuff either). Like I said, it could have just been placebo, but the visual thing was unexpected. If it was real it will happen again but I won't be able to grab more oils until tomorrow. By the time I was leaving the shops the effect seemed to have subsided and wasn't noticeable smoking a couple hours later.The oils likely had limonene and alpha-terpinol as fairly major components and I read that these have limited agonism on 5HT2A receptors (serotonin related and LSD works on them). I think these and similar terpenes have anxiolytic effects and were said to be stimulating too.The taste of the oils wasn't that bad and I don't think with these there is much concern with toxicity so I wouldn't be worried about upping the dosage 5-fold or even more, but I won't go that far yet. Essential oils are often pretty light and less like olive oil types. They dissolved right into my mouth and the flavor hung around for a few minutes but wasn't so bad I felt I had to take a drink of anything. I could see taste being a concern with higher amounts or other ingredients though.I'm interested in trying to mix some terpenes in with QWISO, but it will take me a while to get to make that. It seems like the ideal end product (maybe just my opinion) would be something more like a cannabis caviar or hash with the terpenated hash oil mixed with ground buds."

Here is my post to you in the 710 thread for others to read the idea: http://forumzxmoorof4ja.onion/index.php?topic=442.msg4174#msg4174I did a little more research and have even more ideas, but I want to put a WARNING to people. There's some debate on if it is safe to ingest essential oils. I think it can or can not be but you just have to look at each individually and not as the whole class of essential oils. A couple drops of citrus oil is probably fine, but a teaspoon of wintergreen oil can kill you. Oils can be GRAS (generally recognized as safe) for foods, but only at some dosages. One would have to look closely at the science behind how the GRAS determination is made if going beyond those limits.I'm treating this like RC's, test small first, know your source, etc. Please ask if you have questions, I will try to help.A lot of scent oils or perfume oils can be diluted in DPG or other shit you do not want to eat. A lot of pure citrus oils you get for adding to foods will actually be ""terpeneless"" (technically, this can be as low as 70% terpenes removed though IIRC). So, point being that you might get an oil that is missing what we are after. I'm going to be using pure, unmodified and organic oils as used in natural perfumery.Again like RC's the taste may be unpleasant. ""Terpy"" is a common taste description and not a positive one. The right oils are meant for perfumes, not eating, so I expect a waxy taste as well.Dermal might be a viable route, but again needs caution. A lot of citrus oils are photosensitizers, meaning you get it on your skin and go in the sun it is going to burn you terribly. Bergamot oil is often sold bergaptene free because it is a terrible photosensitizer but other citrus can be too.I didn't realize last night but 1,8 cineol is also called eucalyptol and I have this pure as well for experimentation. I was confused that something I didn't recognize the name of was supposed to be the main flavor. It might end up being worthwhile to go sort of Dr. Shulgin on this. Myrcene seems key because of how it ""adds to capacity"" of CB1 receptors, but maybe there is something structurally similar that wouldn't be naturally occurring. What personally interest me most right now is the borneol. I'm going to start some tinctures soon."

","I believe that food allergies all have to do with proteins. What gets called allergies to something like cigarette smoke are irritations. So, it seems like your allergies wouldn't be set off by using some type of essential oil. I'd think a drop or two of oil under the tongue would work well for administration. I don't know much about allergies so take that with a grain of salt. I'm new to weed chemistry too but I know a bit about oils and flavor molecules. These are the more interesting parts of an entry on myrcene:Myrcene has a pleasant, sweet, balsamic, plastic odor. [plastic sounds bad but a bunch of other sources don't say that and say a ton of other stuff, very varied]Soluble in alcohol and oils; insoluble in waterAroma characteristics at 10%: terpy, herbaceous, woody with a rosy celery and carrot nuance.Taste characteristics at 5 to 100 ppm: woody, vegetative, citrus fruity with a tropical mango and slight, leafy, minty nuance.Natural occurrence: Reported found in Mircia acris D.C.; in the distillates from leaves of Rhus cotinus and Barosma venustum (52and 43%, respectively); in lemongrass, cypress, artemisia; in the fruits of Phellodendron amurense (92%) and Phellodendron japonicum; in the oils of Picea balsamea, Tsuga canadenis, Abies balsamea, clary sage and others. Also reported in over 200 foods and beverages including citrus peel oils and juices, apricot, sweet and sour cherry, berries, guava, pineapple, carrot, celery, potato, bell pepper, black currants, anise, anise seed, cardamom, cinnamon, cassia, clove, capsicum varities, ginger, mentha oils, mace, parsley, thyme, cheeses, cream, pork, hop oil, beer, white wine, rum, cocoa, coffee, tea, mango, tamarind, coriander, gin, sweet bay, prickly pear, calamus, dill, lovage, caraway, buckwheat, corn, basil, fennel, kiwifruit, rosemary, myrtle berry, turmeric, lemon balm, sage, pimento, angelica oil, Roman and German chamomile oil, eucalyptus and mastic gum oil.I looked into the book they cite in the article and it is interesting about other terpenes and what they are thought to do but there isn't enough detail. Some highlights:Limonene increases blood pressure, alertness, and restlessness. Various Limonene analogs can cue the brain to sexuality, buoyancy or focused attention.Pinene is probably responsible for the smell of true skunk varieties. It is a bronchiodialator and might be responsible for the high coming on quickly. It increases focus, self-satisfaction and energy.Terpineol reduces motility by 45% in rat tests and may be responsible for ""couch lock""Borneol is used as a calming sedative in Chinese medicine and is directed for fatigue, recovery from illness and stress. It gives a camphor smell to Silver Haze varieties and has a calming effect as well as psychedelic aspects.Linalool seems to have strong sedative effects.1,8 Cineol is the main ingredient in eucalyptus oil and has a camphor-minty odor. It increases circulation, relieves pain and has other topical uses. It is considered centering, balancing and stimulating.It seems like if you like what a certain strain does for you, say Silver Haze, you could replicate the effects by dosing any other herb with some Borneol.I have another PDF which has a breakdown of the constituent terpenes in various lime and lemon varieties. Lemons generally have more myrcene vs. limes in an avg 1.6:1.1 ratio. Lemons have more limonene, usually like 70-80 vs about 60 average for limes, although the full range is 38-96% of the oil.alpha-Terpineol seems a bit higher in limes, avg. 0.2 vs 0.3%. There's other similar molecules that might do something, I don't know.Borneol isn't listed but the other book says it is synthesized one way from pinene, so maybe there is a metabolic process. There is generally much more pinene in limes than lemons but Eureka lemons have 11% while Meyer has less than 1%.Cardamom caught my eye as having an array of these terpenes including borneol and pinene. I might try some sort of chew of a mixture of black and green cardamom and see if it does anything. I know that I have some lemon and lime oils too. The bad thing is I have barely been able to smoke the past month and when my order gets here, hopefully in the next few days, I am probably going to get high as fuck off one hit no matter what else I do. Maybe I will try a couple drops of oil on day two and see how it compares."

There's this paper regarding Limonene and 5HT2A receptors [Clearnet warning]:  http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-12052008-124938/unrestricted/umi-umt-1101.pdf  The part on cannabis starts at page 85. The full hemp essential oil (no THC/CBD, in a 1% solution) was able to displace Ketanserin at the 5HT2a receptor to about 20% (so 80% strength relative to other numbers I will give). Then they tested individually: β-caryophyllene, 1,8-cineole, d-limonene, linalool, α-pinene, and α-terpinol and only got displacement of 1,8-cineole (7%), d-limonene (10%), and α-terpinol (18%). They also tested carvone which gave 13% displacement, but then adding some of these terpenes didn't push that number higher.   So, that means that there is competition at the binding site and also that there is some unknown element of the full-spectrum cannabis EO that is causing the synergy to displace up to 80%.   These numbers are made up, but I think the way myrcene will work on CB1 receptors is like THC will displace to 20% then myrcene has allosteric modulation that allows THC to go to 30%. If you are just smoking a bit of herb/QWISO, maybe that isn't even enough to hit 20% and saturate your CB1 at all or for long. If myrcene is doing some other stuff like how it is supposed to be part of ""couch lock"" then that will still work I guess.  Whenever you took those synthetics, I think they are often full  CB1 agonists, so they blew you to 100% and weed would never do that even if you smoked a ton. Also, I read that the psychoactive effects of whatever drug have to do with the combination of different receptors being activated, kind of like different fingers hitting a chord on a piano. Synthetics can do weird stuff like work on opiate receptors, so maybe the ""chord"" of synthetics can just be different than regular old herb even though they are both hitting the same note (CB1).  That type of trip doesn't sound fun to me, so I doubt I will try it unless there was a good way to have CB1 antagonism. Δ9-tetrahydrocannabivarin is a CB2 agonist and CB1 antagonist and there are tiny amounts in herb, but someone would have to make that alone as a synthetic.    Sounds tasty but I doubt it will do much even if you ate your whole batch at once. Flavor is definitely a consideration in all of this. We might want linalool for its sedative and pain-reliving effects, but by itself it might bring the taste of a concentrate to be like smoking lavender flowers, so I might end up adding things just for taste. Ginger is toward the top of my list as being good for flavors paired with citrus and also having important terpenes.  Basically, what I am suggesting someone does (and I will test this as soon as I can) is to add some of these oils to their shatter. By adding the right combinations of things, we can take shatter made with any herb and then make it like shatter from the type of strain we want. One blend could be like a heavy sativa and be great for patients who need to smoke for pain relief, then another could be energizing and uplifting like a sativa.  I've seen some people complain that one dispensary/concentrate maker adds 5% d-limonene (maybe residual from winterizing). Doing this doesn't really seem like a bad thing though. I read that one group performed a test giving a concentrate with no terpenes and then one with 50% terpenes and people preferred the one with the terps.  I finally grabbed my oils and have another report. I started drinking some mixed drinks around 10 last night and took 3x drops of a 1% solution of 1,8-cineol (eucalyptol) along with 5x drops of lemon essential oil (probably equivalent to the zest of multiple lemons, both of these ~20μL drops). I mixed up the last few grams of a sativa and an indica-dominant and smoked a bowl of that about 5 minutes later.  I didn't notice the same light sparkly-ness of lights as with the last test, but then I was in a different environment at home versus in the car. I chilled out for about an hour watching some TV and just felt good, but I am not sure what the terpenes were doing if anything. I wasn't that drunk, but about an hour later I decided to take more oils and I am doing this by drying out my mouth between my teeth and bottom lip then dropping the oils there. On round 2, I fumbled one drop I didn't count and remember feeling a bit extra intoxicated, more than I thought I should be at this point, when handling my droppers.  I took 4 more drops of lemon EO (~20 μL) and 1 each lime EO and blood orange EO (~15μL each) and then smoked another bowl. It seems like the effects of these terpenes lasts about 1-2 hours, because they seem to taper off even when I smoked more 3-4+ hours in.  I don't have a great description of how I felt after round 2, but I am fairly convinced the terps were doing something and whatever that was I liked it. I got the urge to smoke a 3rd bowl at about another 30 minutes in, but my tolerance is such that I don't feel anywhere near this fucked up when I usually smoke a few bowls. Being drunk probably throws this off some though. At least I stopped being dumb and finally grabbed my oils so I can test more, but I am going to be away for next week.  Besides knowing that the 1,8-cineol is pure I don't really know the full composition of these citrus oils. Limonene is certainly a major component, but it could be a blend of isomers (not pure d-limonene) and then there is a collection of stuff like terpineols and maybe even a touch of the other major terps like myrcene and linalool. If limonene is supposed to be energizing and an anti-depressant, I could believe it was having such effects on me because I definitely felt good.","First night:  effect was negligible, if at all.  I used a fresh red mango, ripe but not overly so.  I ate some and i also chewed some and left it in my mouth for as long as I could tolerate.  It was actually quite hard for me to hold onto it for more than 30-60sec before the urge to swallow happened.  I have no patience and saliva was building up at an alarming rate .I had some QWISO from my leftover AfrikanSun bud sample.  Not saying anything about his more than generous sample.   It does have THC and a nice light spicy taste .  I'm a nightly vaper and have recently started concentrates in a small way that I hit on occassionally during the day.  My tolerance is there, but I don't know how it is in comparison to others.   I saw no real perceivable difference pre mango and post mango taken at different intervals.  It's a very light strain and the QWISO i made is also a light hitter.I'm going to let these ripen up more since I read that myrcene is higher when very ripe.   In a couple of days I'll try again.And I know what you are saying about synthetics OD.  I once tried JWH (can't remember, was one of the 2 most common at the time, legal then too) and I had no tolerance to THC whatsoever.  Talk about OD feeling.  Near green out, pale to yellow skin, major paranoia about death, time dialation.  Luckily I was able to get my head about and ride out the 2-3 hours before it subsided.  I threw that shit away afterwards.  Only real stuff for me now.;Really couldn't absorb all of that, but sounds like some strange science.  I plan on trying this with my Rangpur limes - once they're finished - hopefully the tequila won't counteract the effects of the lime rinds. If you rest the shaved rinds in sugar, while still fresh and moist, and then cook them slowly in fry pan, they turn into ""candied rinds"", sometimes called ""zest"", as in lemon zest. These work wonderfully to garnish a pie, especially like a key lime or lemon pie, and are quite tasty to munch. But I'm hoping they can also be used to top off a perfect Margarita. I'll try to remember to report back in the fall, they should be ready by then. I think the CD13 may be the right pairing, but I'm out of stock so maybe hard to tell for sure..."

I'm sure I will have more questions like what griddle to buy and such, so maybe you should make the QWISO tek thread we talked about sometime and let's not go too off topic here. I'm thinking taffy-like would be ideal, but I might want to shoot for more like shatter because I will be adding the step of putting a small amount of lipophilic solvent with the terpenes back with the QWISO which should turn it to taffy. If it is already goopy, it would become more though.","Final product outcome is about the purge mostly I think. When all moisture is gone but the surface still looks kinda oily, scrape everything into a pile on parchment, it should be kinda flakey...clean razor blades are key...Then fold parchment and smush oil together, set on warm surface using fingers to smooth the melting pile into as flat as possible, then open parchment like rorschack (sp?) test and set out on griddle open faced with quarters on corners for ~ 30 min. Then fold QWISO on itself and stick in chill chest for a few & transfer to your fav dab container..It should come out shattery, and stay at least pull and snap, more or less. My preference is a more taffy like consistency...seems easier to get on the dabber."

I wish I had more money and time right now to dive into making my own concentrates but I am about to start a new job and money is tight for a while. I want to know how you get QWISO to come out more like BHO/shatter and not like the crumbly fluff. I think the tek I saw that came out like that suggested 99% ISO and more like 15sec washes with everything in a freezer for a long time, like 2-3 days.  I had come across EJmix in my research and it seems very overpriced but that is to be expected with no competition. It doesn't make sense they use all 3 of 400/300/200 so that may be a bit of obfuscation on their part. The number represents an average molecular weight, so you could just use 200 and 400 if you want to end up in the 200-400 range. I'd be happy to formulate a copy of EJmix and open source it if I just had the money and time to play around with it. PEGs are known to decrease permeability with stomach lining (i.e. slow absorption) so similar might happen with inhalation.  Myrcene doesn't interest me personally that much and I don't have it on hand so it will be lower priority to me. I'm such a lightweight that ""raising the ceiling"" on how much my CB1 receptors can take might not matter. For heavier concentrate users it might be more interesting. Along with a-terpineol, myrcene is also suspected to be guilty of causing ""couch lock"", so not sure this is always desirable.  At some point, I will have a response for AngelEyes on linalool and go over some more stuff on what each of these terpenes do.","Thanks so much for the research, experimentation, and knowledge drop, starpower. Your posts are always informative and thought provoking. Recently heard about an interesting product called Ejmix (great amazon reviews) - from the liquidizer site: ""Our special blend of propylene glycol and PEG400, PEG300, and PEG200 for suspending raw herbal extracts for vaporization. ""According to hype it keeps everything in suspension, and makes any oil totally vape-able. Check out the site if you have a chance.It looks promising, and there are a couple folks around here planning to mess around with mixing various cannaoils, so we'll see how that goes.

Either would work I'd think. I guess interest in terpenes isn't so new and I saw one mention of putting myrcene into an alcohol tincture at a 1:125 ratio. This seems about the same as when I have worked with eucalyptol putting it in a 1% solution of PG then further diluting. The terpenes aren't so soluble in glycerine I bet, at least some of them, so you would have to limit it to maybe 20% or less in a finished blend.  I've been kind of busy and have more to reply on, but am still going to be busy a while still too, will try to fit it in though and am still learning a lot. I can report a small test I did and I think it had an effect but I could have been playing tricks on myself.  Since I finally got some herb, I built up a little tolerance smoking a few small bowls every night. Two nights back I hadn't smoked all day and had just been on a bike ride, decided to test and then go run errands for an hour. I took two small (~15µl) drops sublingually of blood orange essential oil and one of lime EO, then smoked a small bowl of sativa dominant herb about 10 minutes later.   10-15 minutes after that, I am pulling into the lot at the shops and noticed a bit of brightness in the lights in my rear views and around me as well as a very soft psychedelic vibe that hadn't been occurring when I normally smoked. The enhanced brightness reminded me of taking LSD with vitamin C (something I have not done for ages, nor have I done much trippy stuff either). Like I said, it could have just been placebo, but the visual thing was unexpected. If it was real it will happen again but I won't be able to grab more oils until tomorrow. By the time I was leaving the shops the effect seemed to have subsided and wasn't noticeable smoking a couple hours later.  The oils likely had limonene and alpha-terpinol as fairly major components and I read that these have limited agonism on 5HT2A receptors (serotonin related and LSD works on them). I think these and similar terpenes have anxiolytic effects and were said to be stimulating too.  The taste of the oils wasn't that bad and I don't think with these there is much concern with toxicity so I wouldn't be worried about upping the dosage 5-fold or even more, but I won't go that far yet. Essential oils are often pretty light and less like olive oil types. They dissolved right into my mouth and the flavor hung around for a few minutes but wasn't so bad I felt I had to take a drink of anything. I could see taste being a concern with higher amounts or other ingredients though.  I'm interested in trying to mix some terpenes in with QWISO, but it will take me a while to get to make that. It seems like the ideal end product (maybe just my opinion) would be something more like a cannabis caviar or hash with the terpenated hash oil mixed with ground buds.",I wonder about the possiblity of vaping myrcene eesential oils mixed with glycerine or pg as an alternative to eating.

Here is my post to you in the 710 thread for others to read the idea:  http://forumzxmoorof4ja.onion/index.php?topic=442.msg4174#msg4174  I did a little more research and have even more ideas, but I want to put a WARNING to people. There's some debate on if it is safe to ingest essential oils. I think it can or can not be but you just have to look at each individually and not as the whole class of essential oils. A couple drops of citrus oil is probably fine, but a teaspoon of wintergreen oil can kill you. Oils can be GRAS (generally recognized as safe) for foods, but only at some dosages. One would have to look closely at the science behind how the GRAS determination is made if going beyond those limits.  I'm treating this like RC's, test small first, know your source, etc. Please ask if you have questions, I will try to help.  A lot of scent oils or perfume oils can be diluted in DPG or other shit you do not want to eat. A lot of pure citrus oils you get for adding to foods will actually be ""terpeneless"" (technically, this can be as low as 70% terpenes removed though IIRC). So, point being that you might get an oil that is missing what we are after. I'm going to be using pure, unmodified and organic oils as used in natural perfumery.  Again like RC's the taste may be unpleasant. ""Terpy"" is a common taste description and not a positive one. The right oils are meant for perfumes, not eating, so I expect a waxy taste as well.  Dermal might be a viable route, but again needs caution. A lot of citrus oils are photosensitizers, meaning you get it on your skin and go in the sun it is going to burn you terribly. Bergamot oil is often sold bergaptene free because it is a terrible photosensitizer but other citrus can be too.  I didn't realize last night but 1,8 cineol is also called eucalyptol and I have this pure as well for experimentation. I was confused that something I didn't recognize the name of was supposed to be the main flavor.   It might end up being worthwhile to go sort of Dr. Shulgin on this. Myrcene seems key because of how it ""adds to capacity"" of CB1 receptors, but maybe there is something structurally similar that wouldn't be naturally occurring. What personally interest me most right now is the borneol. I'm going to start some tinctures soon.  ",

What gets called allergies to something like cigarette smoke are irritations. So, it seems like your allergies wouldn't be set off by using some type of essential oil. I'd think a drop or two of oil under the tongue would work well for administration. I don't know much about allergies so take that with a grain of salt. I'm new to weed chemistry too but I know a bit about oils and flavor molecules. These are the more interesting parts of an entry on myrcene:  Myrcene has a pleasant, sweet, balsamic, plastic odor. [plastic sounds bad but a bunch of other sources don't say that and say a ton of other stuff, very varied]  Soluble in alcohol and oils; insoluble in water  Aroma characteristics at 10%: terpy, herbaceous, woody with a rosy celery and carrot nuance.  Taste characteristics at 5 to 100 ppm: woody, vegetative, citrus fruity with a tropical mango and slight, leafy, minty nuance.  Natural occurrence: Reported found in Mircia acris D.C.; in the distillates from leaves of Rhus cotinus and Barosma venustum (52and 43%, respectively); in lemongrass, cypress, artemisia; in the fruits of Phellodendron amurense (92%) and Phellodendron japonicum; in the oils of Picea balsamea, Tsuga canadenis, Abies balsamea, clary sage and others. Also reported in over 200 foods and beverages including citrus peel oils and juices, apricot, sweet and sour cherry, berries, guava, pineapple, carrot, celery, potato, bell pepper, black currants, anise, anise seed, cardamom, cinnamon, cassia, clove, capsicum varities, ginger, mentha oils, mace, parsley, thyme, cheeses, cream, pork, hop oil, beer, white wine, rum, cocoa, coffee, tea, mango, tamarind, coriander, gin, sweet bay, prickly pear, calamus, dill, lovage, caraway, buckwheat, corn, basil, fennel, kiwifruit, rosemary, myrtle berry, turmeric, lemon balm, sage, pimento, angelica oil, Roman and German chamomile oil, eucalyptus and mastic gum oil.  I looked into the book they cite in the article and it is interesting about other terpenes and what they are thought to do but there isn't enough detail. Some highlights:  Limonene increases blood pressure, alertness, and restlessness. Various Limonene analogs can cue the brain to sexuality, buoyancy or focused attention.  Pinene is probably responsible for the smell of true skunk varieties. It is a bronchiodialator and might be responsible for the high coming on quickly. It increases focus, self-satisfaction and energy.  Terpineol reduces motility by 45% in rat tests and may be responsible for ""couch lock""  Borneol is used as a calming sedative in Chinese medicine and is directed for fatigue, recovery from illness and stress. It gives a camphor smell to Silver Haze varieties and has a calming effect as well as psychedelic aspects.  Linalool seems to have strong sedative effects.  1,8 Cineol is the main ingredient in eucalyptus oil and has a camphor-minty odor. It increases circulation, relieves pain and has other topical uses. It is considered centering, balancing and stimulating.  It seems like if you like what a certain strain does for you, say Silver Haze, you could replicate the effects by dosing any other herb with some Borneol.  I have another PDF which has a breakdown of the constituent terpenes in various lime and lemon varieties. Lemons generally have more myrcene vs. limes in an avg 1.6:1.1 ratio. Lemons have more limonene, usually like 70-80 vs about 60 average for limes, although the full range is 38-96% of the oil.  alpha-Terpineol seems a bit higher in limes, avg. 0.2 vs 0.3%. There's other similar molecules that might do something, I don't know.  Borneol isn't listed but the other book says it is synthesized one way from pinene, so maybe there is a metabolic process. There is generally much more pinene in limes than lemons but Eureka lemons have 11% while Meyer has less than 1%.  Cardamom caught my eye as having an array of these terpenes including borneol and pinene. I might try some sort of chew of a mixture of black and green cardamom and see if it does anything. I know that I have some lemon and lime oils too. The bad thing is I have barely been able to smoke the past month and when my order gets here, hopefully in the next few days, I am probably going to get high as fuck off one hit no matter what else I do. Maybe I will try a couple drops of oil on day two and see how it compares.    ",

I never asked that anyone send me a package from a specific state via USPS or ANY OTHER means.  You assumed when I asked ""Who has X strains and X quality"" that I wanted ""MARIJUANA MAILED FROM COLORADO VIA THE USPS TO MY HOUSE?!?!?!"".  Nope.  3.  I didn't ask about California dispensaries or WA dispensaries, who works with them, or what they sell.  I asked about specific strains and specific quality.  (If you are concerned about legal issues - you SHOULD NOT have vendors giving out locality information in their profiles or names).  Again, you assumed incorrectly.  Yup; I'm hoping eventually some Colorado STRAINS and Colorado QUALITY will show up on DNM's.  Until then - when/if my problems appear confusing or problematic to you - PM me ... we can clear up the misunderstanding much quicker ... and in private?",

Clearnet Warning   http://dcmj.org/ballot-initiative/  Read the full initative above.  Summary:  -  possess up to two ounces of marijuana for personal use; -  grow no more than six cannabis plants with 3 or fewer being mature, flowering plants, within the persons principal residence; -  transfer without payment (but not sell) up to one ounce of marijuana to another person 21 years of age or older; and -  use or sell drug paraphernalia for the use, growing, or processing of marijuana or cannabis.   Opinion  It's the opinion of this poster that this brings up the tiresome issue of federal re-scheduling.  If the federal capital of the US is going to legalize marijuana, it needs to be re-examined on a federal level.  Attorney General Eric Holder has refuted any questions about examing cannabis for re-scheduling, and the administration's ""wait and see"" policy on Colorado is at the very least a kind gesture, when they could easily swoop down and stomp out the whole thing.  I do think that Congress will try and step in to stop this legislation for D.C.  These types of things are very slow moving.  I think it will be a couple of years, should this legislation pass through, before we see the same sort of tourism to D.C., that we are seeing in Denver/Colorado now.  From the first article:   While keeping opsec in mind, what are your thoughts on D.C.?","Organizers for Initiative 71, a measure that would fully legalize possession of marijuana in the District, plan to announce this week that they are closing in on 60,000 signatures  a comfortable buffer over the 22,600 needed to ensure the measure qualifies for the November ballot.;District voters support legalization by a ration of 2 to 1, polls show. The city has medical marijuana dispensaries and is taking steps to soon loosen restraints and let doctors recommend the drug for any ailment. The D.C. Council even voted in March to decriminalize possession, making it a fine of $25, instead of a year-long jail term."

Since the market is smaller and not many orders need extensions the automation is probably not worth the added coding effort yet. But extending all international orders to a longer standard then domestic does make sense. We have had some international orders take as long as 35 days to arrive depending on location and postal service season. This system will definitely need to be improved upon if you plan on not working 24/7 through the christmas season. Every order domestic and international will take much longer then usually and a large influx of extensions will be made. So you have about a 4 month window to decide before the christmas extension rush happens!,"The only problem with this method is that support messages are limited to 3 a day.So if you have more than 3 orders needing an extension (can be often for people ordering about 2 weeks away for shipping - especially with weed travelling from Africa, America and Europe...) you're kind of screwed...

Since I'm only getting a few ounces of each strain from my grower while we are still testing this out to see if it's worth it for him, I still have to pay him ounce prices on the weed he fronts me.   Once I become more established and I am being fronted multiple pounds, and I only have to pay him back pound prices,  I will hopefully be able to offer much larger discounts than I currently am.  Though this shatter is discounted hugely. I will like be selling this exact shatter ounce for $800 after this first one sells.

This is only for the very first buyer. This strain sells at local dispensaries for hundreds of dollars more, but I want to do something special for you guys, so I'm offering this awesome deal. This deal is only valid on a full ounce, and only valid for one buyer. This is a Cannabis Road only deal, as a thanks for providing me with a vendor account, and in celebration of selling an ounce of my Indoor OG Kush the first day here. So cheers!  Don't let the price fool you, this is Grade AAA California medical shatter. This BHO Shatter is made from the nugs of a strain of marijuana that we call Jilly OG. Jilly OG is our own in-house creation, and is a cross between OG Kush and Jilly bean. Two Indica dominant hybrids, that when combined, provide a wonderfully uplifting, and euphoric high. Mentally stimulating, but not overbearing. Very medicinally helpful for this with depression insomnia, stress, and anxiety. Overall we find it to be a very relaxing and positive high.  We make this BHO shatter with the nugs of the marijuana plant, not the shake or trim. The shatter itself has a beautiful dark amber color. It may look darker than it really is in some of the pictures, but that's just because it's so thick. Rest assured, it has that see-through golden look that everyone loves. As for the flavor, it has a wonderfully citrusy taste, with earthy/pine like undertones. Very palatable.   *Due to in transit temperatures, it is recommended to let the shatter chill in a freezer for a few minutes before attempting to play with it.  Distilled Newport butane used, purged in a closed-loop system.

Ive always been one for conspiracies and the like so today has been mostly looking into urban legends based on video footage. A list of videos that may or may not exist, that are either very hard or impossible to find on the .coms,videos so dark and twisted they can make you end your life! so i thought what better place to ask..... Have you ever come across any of these on the dark net?     film - The Grifter. Said to have been filmed in the 1930s this video is said to portray a selection of pictures and sounds, torture, close ups of rotten corpses, people posessed by demons. Its said that people who watch this video experience nausea, trauma, depression and suicide.   film - Red Mist ( this one is my favourite )  this is an episode of Spongebob Squarepants, made by a Scottish animator named Andrew Skinner. the video starts with a salesman telling Squidward that "" the red mist is coming "" Squidward gets depressed and the video starts flashing the images of dead children, amazing grace plays over the top with a voice saying "" do it "" Squidward then kills himself with a shotgun. Three of the animators who viewed this were hospitalised and two committed suicide Andrew Skinner was arrested for attempted murder in 2002.  film - Groupie.  This movie was allegedly filmed during the Antichrist Superstar tour of 1996/8 and shows a Marylin Manson and crew torturing a woman backstage aparantly there is a flash of the woman in ""Dead to the world"" video series.  film - Cervine Birth. Apparantly put onto youtube in 2009, this video was removed for disturbing content. As far as i can tell its a dying animal giving birth to a humanoid.  film - Satans Sphinx  Its said this video was uploaded to the net in 2006 by government officials testing subliminal messaging and human reaction to violence. along with images of death/torture etc played at super speed it also has a  high pitched sound throughout. Watching this video is said to lead to depression and suicide, as such the experiment was abandoned and all traces removed from the net.  And on a slightly different note,  film - The Wizard of Oz  Yes, the proper Wizard of Oz. In the scene when Dorothy, Toto, the Scarecrow and the Tinman start walking down the yellow brick road there is the body of a munchkin thats hung themselves from a tree in the background. Ive looked and looked but cant find it.  Dont anyone be doing anything silly if they come across any of these! :-)  peace",

If replicated in humans this could improve the prospects of using medical marijuana against autoimmune diseases such as arthritis, type1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis.  Despite the ceaseless ads promising that something will boost your immune system as an unquestioned goal, the strength of the immune response is a careful balancing act. Too weak and you are prey to a host of diseases. However, the immune system can also turn on the body itself, leading to a string of serious and sometimes fatal conditions. Finding ways to dial back the response in these cases, without opening up the floodgates to every infectious disease is one of the great challenges of modern medicine.  In the Journal of Biological Chemistry a team led by Dr Mitzi Nagarkatti reveal studies on 609 microRNAs in mice given THC. Of these, 13 showed substantial alteration. MicroRNAs regulate the expression of genes, and those affected in this case change the activation of genes associated with the immune system.  THC mediates its activity through cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) the authors say. While CB1 is highly expressed in the brain, and to a lower extent in peripheral tissues, CB2 is predominant in immune cells. Therefore, besides it psychoactive effects, THC can suppress inflammation through activation of cannabinoid receptors on immune cells, using multiple pathways.  The team's findings leave a lot of questions unanswered. Besides the question of applicability to humans, the timeframe of the effects is unclear  some are probably temporary, while others may be more permanent. However, the authors argue, The current study opens new avenues to investigate the epigenetic pathways through which THC regulates immune response. If the exact mechanisms through which THC affects immune response can be identified it may become possible to establish which autoimmune diseases are most likely to benefit from its use.  While some less than credible websites are keen to promote marijuana as a universal panacea, its most widely recognized medicinal uses are in treating nausea induced by chemotherapy and weight loss from AIDS. It is more widely recommended for pain and muscle spasms, but the idea of using it to treat multiple sclerosis is not new.  The researchers also have plenty of concerns about marijuana, noting prenatal exposure to THC causes T cell dysfunction in the offspring. They also found disturbing signs that the BRCA2 gene may be suppressed by THC. BRCA2 is famous for its association with early onset breast cancer, but this is because the BRCA2 protein normally suppresses tumor growth, and mutated versions fail to provide this protection, allowing tumors to flourish. Consequently, it is possible that suppressing BRCA2 could increase the risk of breast cancer, in contrast to research suggesting another active component in marijuana may have benefits for breast cancer.   Again, further research may help quantify this risk, and assist in working out when the increased dangers from marijuana use outweigh the benefits.  For those wondering, the THC was injected into the mice, rather than being supplied in the form of joints or hash cookies.

Though not all outgoing messages need to be encrypted. A lot of the time we are not sending out any incriminating information and adding 5 keys to our key chain a day is pointless. But even if a vendor asks you to utilize plain text just use PGP. If they do not have enough time in the day to decrypt your personal sensitive information they probably do not have enough time to package your product properly either.  If they have a million customers and deem it to be to time consuming they should increase the cost of the product they offer turn up the profit per sale and decrease the amount of sales that flow through them. There fore keeping the same profit but doing less work for it. Just my 2 cents stay safe and realize many people were busted from SR1 because they did not use PGP.,

This rubbed me the wrong way, and I'd like to first explain why, and then ask your opinion on the matter. I say that ALL communication with a vendor should be encrypted. Messages that aren't encrypted could be eavesdropped on or surveilled. The more communications that are collected and gathered about you could eventually remove your anonymity. Spelling mistakes, speech patterns, and more can be used to pick you out of a crowd. Why take the chance?  Also, if we are switching back and forth between encrypted and non-encrypted communications, we are leaving another opening for human error to creep in. Imagine accidentally sending your address unencrypted. No, it is better to get in the habit of ALWAYS using encryption. My freedom is worth more than the extra minute or so it takes to view my encrypted message.

And the exchange prices we use are used to calculate the price that the buyer pays based on what the seller is selling it for.   While this seems like a simple feature, it's actually quite complex. So we can consider it, but much more detail and thought is required to implement something like this.  Thanks!",It would be nice to implement a way to set your own BTC price. Localbitcoins and other exchanges usually have a different price for bitcoins than what the site uses so I have to calculate manually what all the prices will be. Instead I'd like to be able to put in what I will be paying for the bitcoins (somewhere in user settings or something) and have the USD/other currency price be based off of that. I posted this on the CannabisRoad subreddit but this forum seems like it gets a lot more traffic.

There are of course many different BTC wallets out there, the below is a starting point for your research, proceed carefully        LadyHawke.   BITCOIN CORE is a full Bitcoin client and builds the backbone of the network. It offers the highest levels of security, privacy, and stability. However, it has fewer features and it takes a lot of space and memory.  MUILTIBIT is a lightweight client that focuses on being fast and easy to use. It synchronizes with the network and is ready to use in minutes. MultiBit also supports many languages. It is a good choice for non-technical users.  HIVE is a standalone wallet for Android, which requires no external server or account. It focuses on usability, yet provides a range of advanced features, such as touch-to-pay via NFC or reliable payments via Bluetooth. Hive Android is extensible through plugins.  ARMORY is an advanced Bitcoin client that expands its features for Bitcoin power users. It offers many backup and encryption features, and it allows secure cold-storage on offline computers.  ELECTRUM's focus is speed and simplicity, with low resource usage. It uses remote servers that handle the most complicated parts of the Bitcoin system, and it allows you to recover your wallet from a secret phrase.  BITCOIN WALLET is easy to use and reliable, while also being secure and fast. Its vision is de-centralization and zero trust; no central service is needed for Bitcoin-related operations. The app is a good choice for non-technical people.  MYCELIUM Bitcoin Wallet is an open source wallet for Android designed for security, speed, and ease of use. It has unique features to manage your keys and for cold storage that help you secure your bitcoins.  BLOCKCHAIN.INFO is a user-friendly hybrid wallet. It stores an encrypted version of your wallet online but decryption happens in your browser. For security reasons, you should always use the browser extension and email backups (and keep that email secure) .  BITGO is a multi-signature wallet offering the highest levels of security. Every transaction requires two signatures, protecting your bitcoins from malware and server attacks. Private keys are held by the user such that BitGo cannot access the bitcoins. It is a good choice for non technical users.  GREENADDRESS is a user-friendly multi-signature wallet with improved security and privacy. At no time your keys are server side, not even encrypted. For security reasons, you should always use 2FA and the browser extension or Android App.  COINBASE is a web wallet service that aims to be easy to use. It also provides an Android web wallet app, merchant tools and integration with US bank accounts to buy and sell bitcoins.  COINKITE is a web wallet & debit card service that aims to be easy to use. It also works on mobile browsers, has merchant tools, point-of-sale payment terminals. It is a hybrid wallet and full reserve vault.  ",

More clever scams will still allow some people to stay in escrow, but will silently encourage all their customers to FE.  The most obvious red flag to look out for is if a vendor asks you to FE despite their profile mentioning nothing about it . This is the true mark of a scam, and should ring alarm bells in your head big time. The best scammers are actually quite intelligent and good at their craft, and if you read nothing else of this post, read this section and really let it sink in, because this is how you will lose serious money.   The second thing to catch my eye is the price increments/price breaks on different quantities of items. The more clever scammers will get this part right, but it will allow you to pick out some obvious ones.  For example, CannabisCompany is offering half ounces for $99.99, but offering half pounds of the same stuff for $999.99. This is rarely how business really works. No one marks down that much for that small of a volume increase. But then the clincher for me is that they sell pounds for $1999.99. Now if you can offer a $600 price break to people buying half pounds over ounces, but $0 price break to people who buy twice that amount? By itself this is not unheard of, as vendors like BudCentral (definitely not a scammer, and sorry for using you as an example BC, message me if this isn't alright) offer pounds for exactly 2x price of half pounds, but generally if you have a gigantic supply and you want to encourage big buyers, you give a discount on pounds. You will notice that BudCentral prices at about $190 per oz, then $1200 a half - a discount for sure, but not such a gigantic one as to not make sense.  Whereas with CannabisCompany, $199 and $999, to give such a huge discount on a half pound, but then no additional discount on a pound, just doesn't make financial sense. As a customer it will be harder for you to pick up on this, but just look for stuff that doesn't seem to make sense and use that to evaluate the risk. One price mess-up could just be an error, a series of them is either a sign of incompetence or scammery.   The next one is communication. I don't even use the markets as a buyer, but if I did, I would NEVER EVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE give money to someone I had not communicated with personally in advance.  Send them a message . You don't have to send something detailed and elaborate, just ask one or two really simple questions, or even just a ""Hey, just wanted to check in and make sure you still have xxxxx product still in stock, looking to place an order soon."" That will take the vendor about 5 seconds to respond to, and gives you a big insight into their personality, their business sense, their activity on the market, etc. If a vendor is taking multiple days to respond to a simple message, or worse ignoring it entirely, you have just avoided a situation that could potentially be extremely frustrating for you. I don't know about you, but for me, I don't mind if there are issues, delays, problems, etc., so long as the person I am working with can communicate with me about it.   Another seriously important red flag is the perceived ""effort"" they have put into their profile, listings, etc. This is hard to quantify and describe, and probably even harder for buyers to understand as they aren't setting up vendor accounts. But just look at their profile, their listings, their pictures, their forum postings, the total cumulative efforts they have put into their name and business. How much time do you think it took them? A few minutes? A few hours? A few days? Depending on what you are purchasing and how big your purchase is, this should be a huge factor in your mind. For me, looking at a profile like CannabisCompany, I can only imagine the profile was set up in less than 30 minutes at most: there are a total of 3 or 4 paragraphs at best, which appears to have been written by someone with a 5th grade grasp of English with a disdain for spell check. Now there is nothing inherently wrong with running a business that didn't take a lot of effort to set up, but I would use an analogy to describe this: Lemonade stand.  I'm fine with spending 50 cents at a little lemonade stand made out of cardboard and coolers, because they are just selling lemonade. However if there was a ""Television and DVD player"" stand with the same amount of effort put into it as a lemonade stand, I would be extremely wary of purchasing any televisions from it. Why? Because the amount of effort that was put into the storefront is not commensurate with the value of products being sold. Same with vendors. If someone like CannabisCompany only spends 30 minutes on a storefront that claims to be moving pounds of weed (significantly more valuable than television sets), I look at that the same way I would look at a lemonade stand trying to sell TVs. Wary.  Now keep in mind, that doesn't even necessarily mean that the shady lemonade stand isn't selling TVs. It may even be a good deal, and a good way to get a cheap TV. However, it is important to keep in mind that the shady lemonade stand only has about 30 minutes worth of work tying them to the ""reputation"" they have created. If they want to bail, they are losing only a few minutes of work, so even if they only scam one customer in the process it was probably worth it for them. If you get the TV home and it doesn't work, what are you going to do? Take it back to where the lemonade stand was and hope it's still there? Exactly.   You feel more comfortable purchasing a TV from a brick and mortar store because you know, at least unconsciously, that they have put so much effort into their business that ripping you off wouldn't even be close to worth it for them. They are in it ""for the long haul,"" so to speak. You need to use this same mindset on the darknet markets. A profile with like 3 pictures total, two paragraphs of text, and presence on only one market is the literal equivalent of a lemonade stand. Don't give a guy behind a lemonade stand hundreds of $ and expect not to get ripped off. I wouldn't even give a lemonade stand $0.50 in advance for a lemonade tomorrow, which is basically what these guys are doing.  In comparison, the vendors who have storefronts on multiple marketplaces with numerous and detailed descriptions, pictures, review threads, forum posts, etc., have all clearly put a lot of effort into their business. This doesn't mean they aren't capable of scamming you - but it does mean that, like the brick and mortar TV store, they just have a lot of financial motivation to do the right thing, even if they are a scammer at heart. Look on reddit, look on the hub, look at other markets, do a little research. If you can't be bothered, don't be bothered when you lose your money.",

Good question.  I think the first thing to understand is that this is dramatically different for domestic shipments as opposed to international ones that have to clear customs. A shipment that has to clear customs will be opened and inspected as a matter of course, and a simple layer of disguise on the items in question is often enough to have the overworked inspector pass it along without too deep of an examination.   A domestic shipment (within the USA anyway) will never be inspected unless a federal warrant is acquired to search the package. If a federal warrant is acquired to search your package, it doesn't matter even a little bit how cleverly you think you have hidden the items, they will find it if it's in a toaster, a dvd case, a chip bag, whatever, they are aware of all those tricks. You are not going to be hiding anything from someone who went through the trouble of getting a federal warrant to search the package. There is a huge difference between getting items past a customs inspector and getting items past a trained law enforcement professional with a federal warrant.   So as you can imagine, the stealth requirements for both types of shipments are rather different. However in both domestic and international you will want the bare minimum stealth for mailing, which is 1) NO ODOR!, and 2) NO red flags.   What are red flags? Well, every USPS employee is told to look for suspicious packages. The criteria they are given for determining if a package is suspicious is as follows:  1) No Return Address. Number 1 red flag. If you do nothing else, don't fuck this one up.   2) Restrictive Markings. (i.e. writing ""Personal!!"" or ""DO NOT X-RAY"" or something on a package. A legitimate business would not do this.)  3) Excessive Tape. Envelopes sealed with tape are generally considered excessively sealed already.

Pretty obvious, but it is important to look professional.   5) Any unknown powders, oils, residues, or other suspicious substances on the exterior of the package.

This by itself obviously not a giant flag, but it is on their list.  7) Excessive postage. A real business would not overpay for postage as they are concerned with their bottom line. Don't overdo the stamps. Only people sending drugs are going to put twice as many as they need. Make absolutely certain you don't under-pay with the stamps either though of course.    Any strange odor, or atypical smell, ESPECIALLY that of cleaning products, perfume (illegal to mail), dryer sheets, and COFFEE.

I put vac seal bags on about the same level as newspaper or saran wrap in terms of actually containing smell. Two or more layers of mylar bag is the most effective smell proofing barrier you will find.   For domestic shipments the most important stealth factor not typically mentioned is that your package basically has to be able to withstand being run over by a bus. Multiple mylar bags and clever containers and decoys don't do very much good if it all rips open the first time one of your packages falls off a cart or gets shoved into the processing stream for envelopes and crushed by rollers. Some mylar bags are very effective for preventing smell, but have a very low resistance to puncturing and tearing, and I have tested many of them and found that some are completely inappropriate for shipping.   Appropriate use of tape, appropriate bags, appropriate amount of air left in the bags as a cushion, a seal on the bag strong enough to contain a serious amount of pressure. I have seen bags sealed once with a typical heat sealer that you can squeeze very hard and then pop open the seal - not good!",

Essentially, with stealth, the vendor is aiming to make the package not stick out at much as possible, they want it to look like half the stuff going through the mail, that might mean making it look more like business mail, due to the rise in online shopping in general, though this leaves them with an issue of return addresses (they're not going to put their house on there) but there are guides to this elsewhere.   When dealing with cannabis smell can be an issue, which is why it should have two layers of smell protection in the form of vacuum sealed food packaging, normally one of those is in the form of Moisture Barrier Bags.

Take your time making everything look ordinary and professional and the post will never take a second look at the item. As to interior stealth methods many vendors have varying beliefs on what is good and what is not. I would recommend counseling with your lawyer on this case as there are actually many rules and regulations on interiors of package that can lead to an automatic complete opening due to all vendors using enclosures. The rules and regulations on this topic actually is very consistent nationwide and as long as you have a competent counsel they can direct you in the right direction.,"What is stealth? Good question.I think the first thing to understand is that this is dramatically different for domestic shipments as opposed to international ones that have to clear customs. A shipment that has to clear customs will be opened and inspected as a matter of course, and a simple layer of disguise on the items in question is often enough to have the overworked inspector pass it along without too deep of an examination. A domestic shipment (within the USA anyway) will never be inspected unless a federal warrant is acquired to search the package. If a federal warrant is acquired to search your package, it doesn't matter even a little bit how cleverly you think you have hidden the items, they will find it if it's in a toaster, a dvd case, a chip bag, whatever, they are aware of all those tricks. You are not going to be hiding anything from someone who went through the trouble of getting a federal warrant to search the package. There is a huge difference between getting items past a customs inspector and getting items past a trained law enforcement professional with a federal warrant. So as you can imagine, the stealth requirements for both types of shipments are rather different. However in both domestic and international you will want the bare minimum stealth for mailing, which is 1) NO ODOR!, and 2) NO red flags. What are red flags? Well, every USPS employee is told to look for suspicious packages. The criteria they are given for determining if a package is suspicious is as follows:1) No Return Address. Number 1 red flag. If you do nothing else, don't fuck this one up. 2) Restrictive Markings. (i.e. writing ""Personal!!"" or ""DO NOT X-RAY"" or something on a package. A legitimate business would not do this.)3) Excessive Tape. Envelopes sealed with tape are generally considered excessively sealed already. For packages this is more vague, but USPS workers are just normal people, so look at a package and ask yourself what you think - ""does this package seem to be 'excessively' taped?""4) Miss-spelled words, or being ""badly typed or written."" Pretty obvious, but it is important to look professional. 5) Any unknown powders, oils, residues, or other suspicious substances on the exterior of the package. Oily stains, discolorations, water spots, etc. are all part of this. Set your package down in your coffee ring? Scrap it and get a new one.6) Mailed from a foreign country.

Printed labels for addresses.  Since it is trying to look like normal packages I like to see a logo/business name Proper postage.  I used to think that printed postage was best because that's what the internet said.  A few good forum posts changed my mind.  stamps are perfectly acceptable and preferred if they are not excessive (20 1cent stamps..hell no) and applied neatly.  If it stands out I don't like it.  Using online postage can be tracked easier since the data now exists at the postage provider's site. Absolutely no smell from outside. Securely sealed but no excessive tape. Visual barrier so you just don't see baggies inside.  can be a box, trinket, small gift with items inside.  Well sealed by mylar - at least 1 layer, if not 2.  this stuff really controls the smells. Normal vacpac/ziploc to contain.",

Or is stealth only supposed to stop them from finding drugs if they only look at the package? Also, I'd like an example of stealth. I mean, not one from a vendor. Just an example. Make something up.

We end up using mixed measurements because avoirdupois ounces are absolutely barbaric and aren't good for anything. Decently accurate scales will always measure in grams, not ounces, for example.

Placed the order on a Tues. he marked as ""shipped"" on Wed. I was excited and couldnt wait as i believed my pavkage would arrive in a week or so. and right now as we speak im still waiting for it to arrive here to the southern US. We spoke on a few accasions (once about 7-8 days into it, and again at 14 days) about the matter and both times he said he ""expected it to have arrived by now"" and said there ""seems to be a delay"" somewhere in the postal system. Your guess is as good as mine as to what that actually means as i know it could mean a lot of things.   ",

I received my purchase in good time, a week to the UK. Everything was in order stealth-wise and the shake is really lovely stuff, a sticky(not damp) sheet of slightly compressed tiny buds and sugar leaves. I expected more small leaves or sticks but I didn't find any stick, the ratio of popcorn buds was higher than I thought it would be, got a few free seeds too. To smoke it's great, better than a good deal of whole bud I've had in the past. I reckon some really nice extractions could be done with this shake. The vendor is very friendly and quick to reply to messages too, so I highly recommend them and I'll be back when I have some extra pennies  ",

Vendor honored his word of replacing the accidental mixup and underweight of the previous order with a generous compensation we had agreed on. And with that still came overweight also    Stealth was good, packing as well, weed is a bit flattened but very acceptable for the Darknet.  Excellent communication with the seller who proved honest and did the investigation search on his side to see where things went wrong and coorect the similar mistake with others.  Weed is quite nice, good taste, pleasant high.  BCDirect seems to be one of those really good vendors.  I definitely Trust him !",

Price / quality ratio is good.  There was only one slight problem concerning the weight. It came in 10g short. Not really a problem as communication was very very good with the seller. He checked into the problem and realized there was a scale mistake and offered me a fair compensation. I'm waiting on the reship now.  I'll be trying some of the other strains soon also and will let you know.  So far I trust this seller, he seems honest and with good feedback so far.  ",

I think it could be a good feature, but it'd have to have two party confirmation in order for the vendor not to ship and then come back only to find that the order was canceled.   I think it'd also cause many vendors to skip the processing stage and immediately move it to shipping - which would then cause issues with slow delivery times because buyers would think it already shipped when it may not have.  Not to mention bringing scamming buyers who know how to use the trick to this market.   So, yeah, as long as it keeps that issue in mind while implementing then I think it'd be ok",

US GOV""T Increases Funding for TOR + $1.8 Million!",Cannabis Road Discussion/Security,"Tor, the internet anonymiser, received more than $1.8m in funding from the US government in 2013, even while the NSA was reportedly trying to destroy the network.  According to the Tor Projects latest annual financial statements, the organisation received $1,822,907 from the US government in 2013. The bulk of that came in the form of pass-through grants, money which ultimately comes from the US government distributed through some independent third-party.  Formerly known as the onion router, Tor is software which allows its users to browse the internet anonymously. It works by bouncing connections through encrypted relays, preventing any eavesdropper from determining what sites a particular user is visiting, or from determining who the users of a particular site actually are. That makes it popular amongst organisations trying to promote freedom of speech in nations like China and Syria  but also popular amongst users trying to evade surveillance in the West.  The two largest single grantors of federal money were SRI international, a non-profit research and development centre that aims to bridge the gap between abstract research and industry, and Internews Network, an international non-profit that funds programmes supporting democracy and human rights. The latter gave $555,413 in funding originally from the US Department of State, while the former gave $830,269 in funding ultimately stemming from the US Department of Defense.  The Tor Project also received direct funding from the National Science Foundation and the US Department of State, totalling $100,325 and $256,900 respectively.  The continued funding of Tor by the American government, including (indirectly) the Department of Defense, stands in stark contrast to the Guardians revelation in October 2013 that the National Security Agency and GCHQ were attempting to destroy the network. Documents obtained by the Guardian detailed proof-of-concept attacks designed to either bring down the Tor network entirely, or to de-anomymise users.  Despite the NSAs attacks on the service, federal funding of Tor has actually increased year-on-year. In 2012, the organisation only received $1.2m in funding from the US government, none of which was direct.  Clearnet Source",

I almost always use Grams when I am searching for anything DNM related and I would love to see listings and vendors from CR in the search results. This is what their FAQ says about it: Send them an email and get started!  Also, I like how Agora does their auto-finalize. The way they do it is the order is auto-finalized 14 days after communication has stopped on the buyer's end. (If the buyer hasn't msged the seller in 14 days, the order is auto finalized). However, they have a seperate page on their site for each order where all of the messages related to that order are. I have not bought anything off of CR so I am not sure how your orders work. Anyway, hope my ideas help!  Thanks DudeGuy123",We have built an api system for markets to install. It is very easy and usually only take an hour or so to implement.

You're saying you have CO2 tanks hooked up to an automation system.  Was this something off the shelf, or was this a home-built rig? Do you have any pics of the hydroponic systems, CO2 systems, etc?  Do you have your lights on an automatic height adjuster, etc?  Of course only comply with pics or information that you feel wouldn't jeopardize you in any way.  I love technical things and love seeing how different individuals implement technology.  It keeps me having an open mind and allows my 'think outside the box' mentality to get some exercise now and then.   Thanks man!",CO2 stuff...

Crazy!  I'm going to be adding in some lights soon, hopefully that'll speed up my grow.  I'm going to be leaving my grow to sit for a few days without interaction soon though... Would it be best to leave the lights on 24/0, or to leave them off? I don't have any timers, so I can't have them automatically turn on/off, unfortunately.  I think they would go dry if I left them on 24/0...","I couldn't agree more with TBC about the 600 watt HID light being the way to go.  When I started growing I used a 400 watt HID lamp.  When I outgrew my first closet grow space and  switched to 600 W and 1000 W lamps, the difference was unbelievable.  It was like I was growing a completely different plant.The one important factor to take into consideration is heat.  A 600 watt HID lamp could be a problem as far as heat build-up is concerned particularly in summer months.  If you don't have some way to provide fresh air to your grow space, a 600 watt light may be a problem.I'm not sure what other states are like, but the range of $0.08 and $0.15  per KW hour is not even close to what it costs in California, particularly if you have more than a light or two.  Rates here go up exponentially as your usage goes up.  The more you use the higher your rates are.  I'm paying an average of around $0.40 per KW hour, so check your local rate schedules in detail before embarking on any sizable indoor grow project just so you know what you're getting into.  Hopefully your local utility doesn't hate growers as much as PG&E does.jack"

A kilowatt hour is basically if you run a 1000w appliance for one hour, or ten 100w lightbulbs for one hour, or one 10w lightbulb for 100 hours.   A 600w light is going to draw about as much electricity as a high end desktop computer and will cost you between $1.50 and $2 per day to run.   To be perfectly honest if you are using 100w of CFLs I would quit dicking around as soon as you get a bit of money together and get a real light. A 600w HPS will literally blow your mind in comparison to some CFLs and is not a very big investment.    Also, while I'm glad people in the thread were able to assist you with the nutrient deficiencies, I feel compelled to point out that when growing in soil there should be absolutely none of that. Plants don't need anything except a decent starting dirt to thrive through the entire growing cycle, and doing anything else is  wildly inefficient in my experience. The amount of money you can spend on tiny bottles of liquid is astounding when a big pile of leaves and sticks will do just as well.   If you live in an area where you have the ability to make a pile of leaves in your yard, please do. Next time your neighbors rake and put their leaves by the road, just go out and scoop up a few big piles, and layer those leaves with some twigs and sticks and put it under a tarp in your yard. Eventually this will break down into the richest, most nutrient dense, complete  and beautiful soil. People get very confused by what it takes to make good soil, and I'm here to remind you it takes ONLY one thing: leaves. Multiple types of leaves from a variety of trees and shrubs is ideal. If you do not have the ability to make a pile of leaves, you're going to have to let other people do it for you.   The organic soil section of the ICMAG forums has some unbelievably good information for this. Thanks out to Burn1 for the following info:   ","Quote from: TheGoodDoctor on August 04, 2014, 09:37:24 pmSorry for the late reply. No I never worried about the electricity it was really only about 50$ higher than what I was paying previously, the price of electricity was'nt high in the location I was living in. Really all that you need to worry about is paying your bill. Electricity can be anywhere between $50 to about $1000 so youre not going to get into many issues with things like the price.It seems that 100w of CFLs (23x4 and then the inefficiencies, fans, etc) would be about $30 to $50 when ran 24/0 for 4 months.I guess there really wouldn't be any worry then, because I saw a shop using all incandescent bulbs still, which use easily 40 watts each or more.;Do you ever worry about the electricity usage looking suspicious? I read that some bitcoin miners had their doors busted down due to looking like they were growing weed on their electricity usage.It's just one of the reasons why I'm trying to stay before below 200 watts...;Here are some tried and true recipes for getting started in organic growing. Pick one of the first two soiless mix recipes for your grow medium. Then, choose a nutrient recipe that will work best for what you have available.Enjoy...Here are two very good organic soiless mixes...LC's Mix is great for any stage of growth. You can germ seeds in it, grow mothers in it, root clones in it as well as veg and flower in it.LCs Soiless Mix #1:5 parts Canadian Sphagnum Peat or Coir or Pro-Moss3 parts perlite2 parts worm castings or mushroom compost or home made compostPowdered (NOT PELLETED) dolomite lime @ 2 tablespoons per gallon or 1 cup per cubic foot of the soiless mix....Wal-Mart now sells worm castings.Or, if you use Pro Mix, Sunshine Mix or Fox Farm mixes...LC's Soiless Mix #2:6 parts Pro Mix BX or HP / Sunshine Mix (any flavor from #1 up) / Fox Farm Ocean Forest or Light Warrior2 parts perlite2 parts earthworm castingsPowdered (NOT PELLETED) dolomite lime @ 2 tablespoons per gallon or 1 cup per cubic foot of the soiless mix.If you use a 3 qt. saucepan as parts in the amounts given above, it equals about 1 cu. ft. of soiless mix and you can just dump in a cup of powdered dolomite lime. The dolomite lime is for Ca. and Mg. not just to adjust the PH of the soil.But, a ""part"" can be anything from a tablespoon to a five gallon bucket. Just use the same item for all of the ""parts"".Now for the plants organic food sourceChoose one of these organic plant food recipes to add to LC's Soiless Mix.RECIPE #1If you want to use organic nutrients like Blood meal, Bone meal and Kelp meal...1 tablespoon Blood meal per gallon or 1/2 cup per cubic foot of soil mix2 tablespoons Bone meal per gallon or 1 cup per cubic foot of soil mix1-tablespoon kelp meal per gallon or 1/2 cup per cubic foot of soil mixor Maxicrop 1-0-4 powdered kelp extract as directed(OPTIONAL) 1 tablespoon per gallon or 1/2 cup per cubic foot of Jersey Greensand to supplement the K (potasium) in the Kelp Meal and seaweed extract.Mix all the dry nutrients into the soiless mix well and wet it, but don't soak it. Use Liquid Karma and water @ 1 tbs./gal. Stir and mix it a few times a week for a week or two so the bacteria can get oxygen and break down the nutrients and make it available. And don't let the mix dry out, keep it moist and add water as needed. It'll also have time to get the humic acids in the Liquid Karma going and the dolomite lime will be better able to adjust the pH of a peat based mixture too.With this recipe, all you need to do is add plain water until harvest.When I'm working with seeds, I punch a hole in the bottom of 16 ounce cups and fill them with plain LC's Mix. Lightly wet the mix in the cups and germinate one seed in each cup. At the same time I mix enough LC's mix along with the blood/bone/kelp to fill all the 3 gallon flower pots I'm going to use for the grow. After about two weeks, the seedlings and the blood/bone/kelp mix are ready. I transplant the seedlings into the 3 gallon pots and just add water until harvest.When you go to flower and pull up the males, save the mix in the pots. It is ready to be used again immediately. Just remove the root ball and transplant another seedling into it.RECIPE #2If you want to use guano in your soil mix...Bongaloid's Guano Mix.Use all these items combined with one gallon of soil mix.1/3C hi N Guano Mexican Bat Guano or Peruvian Seabird Guano (PSG)1/2C hi P Guano (Jamaican or Indonesian Bat Guano)1TBS Kelp Meal(OPTIONAL) 1TBS Jersey GreensandRECIPE #3 (My favorite)If you want to use guano tea and kelp...Guano Tea and Kelp:Seedlings less than 1 month old nutrient tea mixMix 1 cup earthworm castings into 5 gallons of water to make the tea. Add 5 tsp. Black Strap Molasses.Use it to water your seedlings with every 2nd or 3rd watering.Veg mix-1/3 cup Peruvian Seabird Guano (PSG)1/3 cup High N Bat Guano (Mexican)1/3 cup Earth Worm Castings (EWC)(That makes the ""dry mix"". You can make all you want and save it to use later.)Mix with water @ 1 cup of dry mix into 5 gallons of water to make the tea.To that 5 gallons of tea add:5 tbs. Maxicrop or Neptune's Harvest liquid seaweed.5 tsp. Black Strap MolassesUse it to water with every 3rd watering.Flowering nute tea mix:2/3 cup Peruvian Seabird Guano2/3 cup Earth Worm Castings2/3 cup High P Guano (Indonesian or Jamaican)(That makes the ""dry mix"". You can make all you want and save it to use later.)Mix with water @ 2 cups of dry mix into 5 gallons of water to make the tea.To that 5 gallons of tea add:5 tbs. Maxicrop or Neptune's Harvest liquid seaweed.5 tsp. Black Strap MolassesUse it to water with EVERY watering.You can use queen size knee high nylon stockings for tea bags. 3 pair for a dollar at the dollar store. Tell 'em you use them for paint strainers. Put the recommended tea in the stocking, tie a loop knot in it and hang it in your tea bucket. The tea should look like a mud puddle. Agitate the bag in the water vigorously. An aquarium pump and air stone will dissolve oxygen into the solution and keep the good bacteria (microherd) alive and thriving. Let it bubble a day or two before you use it. If you find you are making too much tea and having to throw it out, use 2 1/2 gallons of water and cut the nute amount by half.RECIPE #4Three Little Birds Method40 gallons used soil4 cups alfalfa meal4 cups bone meal4 cups kelp meal4 cups powdered dolomite lime30 pound bag of earthworm castings . . .Thats the basic recipe . . .However we also like to use4 cups of Greensand4 cups of Rock Phosphate4 cups of diatomaceous earthRECIPE #5Fish and Seaweed (This is sooo easy)1 capful is 1 TB or 15 ml.For veg growth1 capful 5-1-1 Fish Emulsion1 capful Neptune's Harvest 0-0-1 Seaweed or Maxicrop liquid1 gallon H2OFor early flowering1 tbs.

Neptunes Harvest 2-4-1 Fish1 gallon H2OAnd now for some more good tips...Seed GerminationFirst, you'll need some LC's MixI use Sunleaves Super Starter Plugs. They are pre-moistened. I drop one seed down in the hole. Gently push them to the bottom of the hole. No need to cover the hole.I use a 5.5"" X 5.5"" square Kord pot or any 1 to 3 quart nursery pot and fill it full to the top with the LC's Mix. Don't pack it. Dig out enough soil mix to place one plug into one pot of mix about level with the top of the mix in the pot.Set the seed in the plug in the mix in the pot aside in a 75 to 85 degree well lit space until the seedlings sprout.Don't water it, sing to it, piss on it or anything else that will kill it with what you may think is kindness.Listen up, this is important...When the leaves of the seedlings are about one inch above the top of the plug, push the plug down into the LC's mix until the seedling leaves are just below the top of the pot. Now use some fresh LC's Mix and gently pack it around the stem of the seedling all the way up to the first leaves. When finished, the mix should be level across the top just below the bottom of the leaves a millimeter or two. Not all seeds will sprout at the same time so you will have to do this at different times. If you don't push the plugs down and support the stems with mix, they will fall over and die. If the stems continue to stretch you can push the plugs down further into the mix. These little suckers are robust below the surface of the mix. Don't be afraid of pushing them down gently.The moisture in the mix should be plenty for several days. Don't let it completely dry out or soak it down with water. Add no nutes to the mix for about two weeks.Your seedlings can stay in these pots for 2 to 4 weeks and then can be transplanted into a grow medium rich in organic food like blood/bone/kelp.I hope this helps get you started. It's worked for me many hundreds of times.Organic pH issuesI hear a lot of people asking or talking about the pH of their organic soil mix or organic nute solution and how they might correct or adjust it. pH in organics is not an issue like it is in synthetic growing.The best place to settle the pH issues in organics is within the grow medium. A medium rich in humates (humus) is the place to start. Humates work to ""buffer"" the pH of organic mediums and the nutes you pour (or mix) into it.Humates come from compost, worm castings and bottled humus. If you use a peat based medum, use dolomite lime to raise the pH of the acidic peat. Dolomite should be used in any soil or soiless medium to provide magnesium and calcium. But since we are talking about pH here, I'll mention dolomite lime's pH correction benefits.A medium of coir has a pH near neutral (or 7.0). But humates are still neded to allow uptake of organic nutrients that are outside a near neutral pH range.With an active medium rich in humates you can pour in nutes like Pure Blend Pro, Earth Juice and guano teas way outside the optimum pH range without worry. The humus will allow the nutes to be taken up through the roots, even at such an extreme pH reading.So throw those pH meters away folks and enjoy the ease and safety of organic gardening.Chlorine tap waterJust a word of caution for you organic heads out there...If you are tapped onto a municipal water supply that uses chlorine to kill bacteria in the water, it'll do the same thing to the bacteria (microherd) in your organic food source.Always bubble your municipal water in an open container (5 gallon bucket) for 24 hours before adding ANYTHING organic to it.FlushingThere is absolutely no reason to ""flush"" organic nute solutions from your soil mix. In an organic grow, the plants don't take up the organic nutes (guano, bone, blood or kelp). The bacteria eat the organic nutes and excrete food that the plant can feed off of. So the organic nutes don't need to be flushed because they never enter the plant. And besides, meals like kelp, bone and blood along with worm castings and dolomite can't be flushed from your soil mix anyway. If you use guano and seaweed, try using plain water or worm casting tea for your last watering or two so the plant can use up what's left in the soil. But drowning your soil with water isn't necessary. "

But even strong phenos can just die though its admittedly rare.  I had a ChemdawgxG13 clone that looked fine, spent a few weeks in flower and was starting to bloom and then it just dried up one day and died.  I couldn't see any reason for it, but it clearly just stopped taking in water and nutes from its roots.  The other plants in the unit were fine so there was no nute lockout issue, and I sprayed the leaves with a foliar plant food to try reinvigorate it with no effect.   The fact that it happened so quickly makes me think the plant just shut off for some reason.   ","Quote from: AngelEyes on July 15, 2014, 06:48:50 pmHas she yellowed all over at once?  If so, and with the dark spots it sounds like sulfur deficiency.  It could just be a genetically weak plant or it could be a nutrient deficiency.It started at one leaf, then spread all over.

As for LED's, we've experimented a bit with one type, known as the ""procyon"".  Its a high quality light with red and blue led's thats about 125w.  It grows beautiful short plants with tight internodal spacing but we don't use it in flower because it doesn't have the power.  The most knowledgeable grower I know of who heavily uses LED's is known as ""LEDGirl"" on, I think its the rollitup forums.  From what I recall, and this was a few years ago, she built her own LED's and knew all the ins and outs.  Her photos showed some truly beautiful plants.  The fact is though that to flower plants with LEDs requires a pretty significant initial investment, and from what she said you still have to keep the lights quite close to the plants as they don't penetrate very well, which means you need a lot of LED's to cover the same area as a 600 or 1000 watt light (which means the wattage savings is not that great all said and done, though the heat waste is definitely less making cooling easier and reducing wasted energy).  Its a complex subject and if you do want to experiment the best way is to buy in slowly and test out each light thoroughly before doubling down.  Anyhow, it sounds like you're going about it all correctly -- doing lots of research up front before making any investment and always learning more.  Its a really fun and rewarding subject with new things to learn all the time for the observant and curious.  ","AngelEyes, you are always so knowledgeable and willing to share.  The whole process is very interesting to me.  I've been collecting my own notes for a few months and eventually will end up trying to grow myown.I'm curious - how long have you been involved in growing?  I think I've talked myself out of  building my own LED setup now.  I actually had a semi long reply all typed up and realized that ""I ain't got time for dat"".  However, some info is in the below link.You got me to research more on my own and I came up with this link.  Quite a read http://www.reddit.com/r/HandsOnComplexity/comments/17nxhd/sags_plant_lighting_guide_linked_together/to anyone, make sure you check out all the links.  Have a nice cold drink ready and some of your favorite bud.  It's gonna be a long night It discusses everything from light temperature, photosynthesis, reflectors, building your own LED setups, space buckets, etc.  What would we do without the internet?  I guess we'd head to the library or our own bookshelf to pick up a paper encyclopedia...  ugh."

For one or two plants a 250 or 400 watt fixture/reflector & ballast with a blue-spectrum bulb for vegging and red spectrum for flower is about as cheap as you can go, and will provide some very nice buds.  But effective penetration is reduced significantly as the wattage drops, which means the lower branches of most marijuana plants won't get enough light from 250w.  A 400w should do well for shorter plants like the squatter indicas and hybrids that grow to 2-3 feet.  TBC's recommend of a 600w is totally correct in the sense that this size light is the most efficient that exists and has enough effective penetration to grow a collection of 4 (or more with a light mover) 3-4 foot plants.    If you want to use lower wattage like a 250, you can look into a ""sea of green"" setup that consists of lots of small plants as opposed to 1 or 2 large ones.  This way effective penetration isn't as important because the plants remain short.  If this seems right for you its also a good idea to look into a broad reflector that will spread the light widely, and perhaps a light mover (though that adds another roughly $100-$150 cost and more complicated setup.  In such a case a 400w might serve you better, though it will generate more heat and electricity usage than the 250 (obviously).  A 250w HID light is the absolute smallest light I would recommend if you want to grow a plant that produces anything but airy popcorn buds.",

So yes, I'm a grow room automation geek in every way.  As far as CO2 control, the climate controller has a built-in sensor that  monitors the actual PPM levels of CO2 in the room.  The logic in the system learns the parameters of the room and CO2 supply equipment flow rates and constantly adjusts its program to avoid overshooting the target CO2 level.  There are cheaper, less effective ways to manage CO2 but controllers like this one are the gold standard in the commercial growing industry.  Jack ","Jack, Even though I have never tried a grow and only have strong curiosities about starting, the supplementation of CO2 intrigues me.  I'm a tinkerer at heart and automation controls are cool.You're saying you have CO2 tanks hooked up to an automation system.  Was this something off the shelf, or was this a home-built rig?Do you have any pics of the hydroponic systems, CO2 systems, etc?  Do you have your lights on an automatic height adjuster, etc?Of course only comply with pics or information that you feel wouldn't jeopardize you in any way.  I love technical things and love seeing how different individuals implement technology.  It keeps me having an open mind and allows my 'think outside the box' mentality to get some exercise now and then.Thanks man!"

If your plants are in big enough pots, they should easily last a few days without being watered.  If you're watering your plants daily they are probably too wet.  Don't water until the surface and an inch down into the soil is pretty dry.  Cannabis doesn't like growing in soggy soil.   You'll get all sorts of problems.  How do I get my plants to grow that big that fast?  It's hard to believe unless you're there watching it happen, but my plants will grow from 6""-8"" rooted cutting size to 4 feet tall and filling the room in under 5 weeks.  To get those kind of growth rates, you really need optimum conditions of lighting, nutrient availability, the right  temps and humidity, and supplemental carbon dioxide.  To get there, I'm growing under a combination of 600W and 1000W high pressure sodium HID lamps.   Dividing the total wattage the the square foot area of the grow space, it comes out to 55 watts per square foot.  Most indoor growers would agree that's about optimal.  HID, LED and CFL are all relatively efficient lightings sources as far as lumens of output per watt.  But the total light output you can get from HID lighting far surpasses anything you can get from LED or CFL light sources.   If you try to figure out how to pack 55 watts worth of LED lights or CFL into each square foot of a grow space, you'll see what I mean.   The 143,000 lumen output of the best high pressure sodium 1000 W lamp is hard to match with any other lighting source.  Light levels are critical to support fast plant growth rates.  But equally critical are adequate nutrients and CO2 in the atmosphere.  I grow with an aeroponic system.  Aeroponics is a soil-less growing method where the plants' roots hang into root chamber and sprayers mist the roots with ultra-fine mist of nutrient solution.  I provide optimum levels of CO2 with a digital controller that monitors CO2 levels on a continual basis and adjusts the levels to 1500 parts per million with supplemental CO2 from compressed gas cylinders.  Natural atmospheric levels of CO2 are 350 to 450 parts per million.  Plants will grow faster with additional CO2 during their daylight hours up to about 1500 PPM.  That may have been information overkill, but I thought it was important to emphasize that to get the best results growing cannabis indoors, a lot of things have to be dialed in just right.  You don't have to do all that to get good results.  But you do need to get the basics right, and a lighting timer is high up on the list of ""must haves"". I'm happy to answer any other questions you have.  JackBlue","I just saw the pics of your plants and They're that tall at 6 weeks!?!?

The one important factor to take into consideration is heat.  A 600 watt HID lamp could be a problem as far as heat build-up is concerned particularly in summer months.  If you don't have some way to provide fresh air to your grow space, a 600 watt light may be a problem.  I'm not sure what other states are like, but the range of $0.08 and $0.15  per KW hour is not even close to what it costs in California, particularly if you have more than a light or two.  Rates here go up exponentially as your usage goes up.  The more you use the higher your rates are.  I'm paying an average of around $0.40 per KW hour, so check your local rate schedules in detail before embarking on any sizable indoor grow project just so you know what you're getting into.  Hopefully your local utility doesn't hate growers as much as PG&E does.  jack",

Urine is an aqueous solution of greater than 95% water, with the remaining constituents, in order of decreasing concentration urea 9.3 g/L, chloride 1.87 g/L, sodium 1.17 g/L, potassium 0.750 g/L, creatinine 0.670 g/L and other dissolved ions, inorganic and organic compounds.  urea = nitrogen, critical chloride =  studies show that chloride is a good micronutrient that balances with potassium and helps with photsynthesis, helps reduce fungal infections, 'fights' with nitrate uptake which may help with plant health potassium - another critical plant element creatinine - some very old papers (early 1900s) discuss this a little.  I don't see any benefit.

Similar CFLs (42 watt) output 2700/2600 lumens, from what I've found.  Unfortunately I'm not yet willing to spend the cash on the HPS lights (plus they're expensive to run).

I'm curious - how long have you been involved in growing?    I think I've talked myself out of  building my own LED setup now.  I actually had a semi long reply all typed up and realized that ""I ain't got time for dat"".  However, some info is in the below link.  You got me to research more on my own and I came up with this link.  Quite a read    http://www.reddit.com/r/HandsOnComplexity/comments/17nxhd/sags_plant_lighting_guide_linked_together/ to anyone, make sure you check out all the links.  Have a nice cold drink ready and some of your favorite bud.  It's gonna be a long night   It discusses everything from light temperature, photosynthesis, reflectors, building your own LED setups, space buckets, etc.  What would we do without the internet?  I guess we'd head to the library or our own bookshelf to pick up a paper encyclopedia...  ugh.

I am also looking to try growing a plant or two and want to see what I can do without breaking the bank or making it hard to hide.   ","If you can only get one light, get a 600w HPS.If you can get two lights, get two 600w HPS.For third or fourth light you can maybe consider a MH or fluroescent veg rig, but HPS lights are just so much more valuable to have IMO.1000watters are great, but if you don't know how to handle the heat I'd be careful with that. 1kw is where you start tripping breakers and such if you're not careful as well."

I have 3 shipping options to the USA. Tracked package, Expedited and Xpresspost. I think Expedited is the best bang for your buck. It gets there is 4-5 business days. Otherwise, if you can wait a week to 10 days, a tracked package is a cheap option at $17.  I've never had a package get seized coming into the US. Once, USPS sent a package destined for Pennsylvania to Porto Rico. It had to then get turned around but finally ended up at the person's door step. Add an extra week for that shipping error. Not my fault. The customer confirmed I put the address down correctly.  Anyway, most of my customers are from the US and I ship there all the time.  Cheers",

I'm a vendor who has been in business for about 2 months on other markets, namely P A N D O R A and A G O R A. If you are a part of those markets you can see I have a 5/5 rating on all transactions.   Read my profile at:   http://cannabiskofvl7pa.onion/vendor-profile/DrDankBud  I am currently out of the Bianca strain but will harvest more in about 2 weeks. I am also going to be growing White Widow XTRM and AK-47 XTRM from Amsterdam Marijuana Seeds.  I know this is a new and small market, but I thought it would be nice to be one of the first on a market. I'm also the ONLY CANADIAN vendor at this time. If there is a growing customer base, and I have some messages and contacts here I would think about doing a special introductory offer as a new vendor. But, I'm also thinking that everyone is new here and needs to wait some time to see where this new weed market goes.  So, feel free to contact me here or on the site, and I'll be sure to respond ASAP.  Cheers, DrDankBud",

Super Silver Haze won first prize at the High Times Cannabis Cup in 1997, 1998 and 1999 and also won awards at the High Times harvest festival. ",

I'm both excited about the seeds and the bud. Just finished a bowl of the haze, and I'm pleasantly stoned. If anyone wants to give growing a try, these would bee some excellent seeds, and you'd pay way more for 1/10 this many seeds  from a seedbank. The bud is bright green and orange, very hairy, as usual. I've been a long time customer of AE and when I heard about the seeding issue, it actually got me excited, that I would be able to grow some of this exquisite strain.   Thanks for the kind buds Ava, as always.",

Pretty sure the raffle rules was just one vote per user account, or, are you saying...    I think I missed that SilverSurfer dude, but it does sound really good (thanks for the review from the misspelled guy). It was a shot of tequila, 1942, to cut the sweetness of that drink, just for a moment it got out of control; don't be concerned, I would never mix it up like that. I think it was lemonade, a shot of sherrie, and a dab of rasberry sherbet, I got half way through and thought, to myself, I was sipping it way too much like a girl, so, BAM42.   I was thinking that it would be enlightenment to contrast the KaliUV against the Traditional, like an experiment, making electricty out of a tomato, or something just like that. If you do make some UVs out of that Mist, please save a portion for my cigar.   I saw the 12"" Elements the other day, and started getting ideas. I know you need a lid of shake to make one of those, but it's the little bombs, every eighth puff, that makes the whole thing a lot of fun. Otherwise, it's just a lot of coughing; good way to fix your allergies, though.  ","The Kali will be ready in early July (it takes 10-11 weeks to finish), so save your bitcoins and vote early and often!Cheers,Ava"

As for the Kali, the last time we offered it was a long time ago if I recall, and it was the UV'd variety.  I'm not going to UV this batch (well maybe some of it) because the UV, IMO, cuts a lot of the strength off the high with the Kali.  The truth is I think its our highest THC strain by far.  I'm not sure because we don't have those fancy labs we can send our buds to like they do in those ""legal"" states in order to test THC levels... but judging from how stoned my friend and I got a couple Christmas Eve's ago right before we did our last minute shopping at the mall I'm gonna say the Kali WILL knock you on your ass if you're not careful.  I'm talking forget your first name kind of high.  Two of us smoked a half of this nice sized Kali jay out of these brown coconut-flavored papers *yum* and not only did we forget why we were at the mall, but we spent the entire time we were supposed to be shopping wandering around in a daze trying to remember where and why we were where we were, and looking for something to drink.  Thankfully we didn't drive ourselves and got picked up by someone who could see clearly because we'd've been in serious trouble trying to drive ourselves home.  When they talk about ""stoned"" driving, well there's stoned driving and then there's STONED driving.  The non-UV'd Kali explains why they call it ""stoned"" in the first place, 'cuz it kinda feels like I imagine it feels after getting hit in the head with a rock, sans the pain part.

To make you feel what I felt, and am feeling.  We'll leave out the longish delay between the ordering and the actual receiving, due to some confusion about some unfortunate seeding Ava and the lovely other folks at Angel Eyes had experienced. It wasn't really that long, but I was dankrupt and that tends to streeeetch things out. Anyways, it came in the mail today, very ordinarily and with no fuss. Packaging was excellent, he said vaguely. But there was to be a small fly in my ointment, as you shall see. As I extracted the precious materielle from its shipping container, I noticed written on the outside of one of the innermost packages: (half what I ordered).  Now, I had ordered (what i'd ordered). But I am looking at the extremely delicious looking and giant bud settling itself down into my stash jar, and what I'm thinking is - ""There is no way this is only a (half what i ordered) It's huge! Look at this thing! It fills my whole jar!"" But I was also noticing that it was not as densely packed as the last order I'd had from another vendor, a different strain. Maybe it is only (half what I ordered)... this might sour this experience a little. But I can't remember where I put my scale, so, a pinch into the grinder goes. Load up my vapor genie with a goodly looking amount, and start having at it. I can measure it later, minus ""a pinch.""  Not very minutes later (clock time), but an eternity later in terms of my perception... many thoughts going through my head, the foremost of which was ""Hooooly shiiiiit. I don't even care if I DID get half my order by mistake. This stuff is out of this fucking world. This order here'll last me like... a nice long time."" I start picking up the various bags that are littering my floor, and go to look inside the box.  THERE. IS. ANOTHER. BAG. IN. THE. BOX. I... I... feel like the luckiest man in the world. So! The HIGH! If someone asked me what a ""head high"" was, I'd hand this to them and grin from ear to ear. It is pleasant, and creative, perceptive... good lord, I think I almost went mad listening to someone using a vacuum cleaner downstairs before I figured out what it was. I'm still not even sure the sound was there at all, to be honest. This shit. Is. Amazing.  Super Silver Haze? That's not the coolest name I've ever heard. But this could be named ""Blob of crap"" and I'd keep coming back for more. I could not be a happier customer.  Thaaaank you thank you thank you Ava and other AngelEyers! WELL WORTH THE WAIT.

If that dude was a fool, I must have been TheRealJoker.   My rolling machine got carried away and produced a single double wide, it burned sort of wrong, but I had the meatloaf and that made up for it all. The Korean exchange rate is floating things pretty high, but I was told that bitcoins aren't affected this round, so I should be able to get some for the KaliMist event, next month. The double wide roach was a Trifecta, so I had to go to bed soon. I'll send you a letter after the start of the next growing cycle.   I'm thinking that a joint that thick should probably be wrapped twice, assuming, of course, Elements 1 1/4s, or, maybe, like, shit man, I could just use a full 1 1/2s, so, just trying to figure out that equation of the exchange rate, burn rate divided by paper thickness, function almost equals fog result.

Looks like TheAva had been successful with the whole seedlessness thing since I found nary a little bug in that buds. I know it was a lot of hard work, but the whole town is pretty happy about all your efforts. Those buds are so Bling - I decided to try my new sex toy that night.   I usually roll all my own Js, and am pretty good at it, I like to smoke them, and the roaches come out quite good. However, they have this little automated rolling machine, and it only costs five buck, so I thought to myself, self, TheDude should give that a try.    Like, shit, man, like these aren't even like joints anymore, they're Cannabis Cigarettes, so soft and smooth, so long and lean, you cannot smoke one, just take a few puffs and, when you awaken, see if you can find the damn thing. I was lucky that Amber was there to put things back into place, or I may never have found that roachette.   Oh my, now that is a monster roach, came out just like a hammerhead shark, so I quickly threw it into its jar, to play with all of its friends, in the garden of Nineva. I fertilized them with a little NL5 pixie dust and slammed on that cover (I used the 420 jars for longer cures, but wish that I had investigated those other jars that Ava recommendered).    I'll take a look in there by next month, when the KaliMist is supposed to be prepared.

Ask any seller & they'll tell you how the weed business is so thoroughly dominated by bag appeal, smell & traits that have nothing to do with how you feel when you smoke their wares. It's driven by sellers of commercial MJ seeds, commercial MJ growers & dealers and perpetuated by buyers that just want to be able to discern quality weed from crap. I speak as a former ""blind man"" who only found out what's what by accident & by learning from wise growers. I'm gonna break down the falsehoods & provide explanation of their origins where possible. Before I go further I want to add this caveat to this post: this is not to tar as ""bad"" any particular type of seed breeder, growers or strain type.  My sole intent is to shed light on the differences available to people & help explain some of the reasons behind the average consensus on MJ.  I think it would be of the most benefit to start with the most pervasive and accepted myth about how to discern the good MJ from the mediocre or the plain bad.  The hands down best marijuana I ever smoked was at a New Year's Eve party, it's easily the best high I've had before or since. I was just sitting against a wall when the fellow next to me asked if I'd like to do a jay with him & since I was getting tired of the party & feeling kind of irritable & annoyed so I figured, what the  hell. To say it was transformative would be an understatement - I went from half asleep, annoyed and ready to go home to pleasantly alert & awake. It worked it's ways subtly & expertly as if some master was guiding the high for me. I'll broadly put into words some of it: it was the first high I ever had where I was able to have a clarity of mind without any trace of jitters, paranoia or anxiety but still with enough psychoactive THC in it to make everything feel magical & interesting without overwhelming my head. It just put a bustle in your hedgerow  .  Combined with a very pleasurable opiate like body high, which stood out in stark contrast to the anti-social stone I'd come to expect that always left me ""burnt"" or couchlocked & stupid with the negative effect lasting for about 3 days after smoking what I and everyone else thought was ""the good stuff"". It was unique (I remember I was able to make music in my head which would have any effect on me I wanted & I chose to make music to make me giggle to myself) and very different from all my previous experience with MJ up to that point. It was like being under a fairy's spell. Even the comedown was pleasant with nice hazey overtones coming into the picture.   The surprising part is it didn't look, smell or smoke like what I thought I knew quality MJ always looked and smelled like. In fact it was some of the humblest looking bud I've ever seen. It bore no famous name, he just referred to it as ""Thai stick"" which at the time and place was a generic term used for a range of weed regarded as low- mids, really anything that wasn't called ""hydro"" or ""kind bud"" which was supposed to be superior to this unimpressive looking stuff in every way. It was just plain old brown weed that didn't have a particularly strong smell or a designer smell - no diesel fuel or any ""exotic"" scent at all, it just smelled like weed. The buds were airy, leafy things. I was sure it was semi-shake ditch weed before I smoked it. Boy was that a revelation. Haven't had better since.  Which brings me right around to the biggest and most pervasive myth of the business which is that the best weed is crystal covered fat nugs that have a pungent smell. This myth didn't just spring up randomly, it was and still is pushed by dealers, commercial growers and the seedbanks & breeders that cater to them who make up the vast majority of the marijuana market. When I say commercial grower I refer to growers who largely deal in high weight. Angel Eyes is more of an artisan's collective where the goal is to make the best not necessarily the most profitable business. The commercial grower's business model is to move as much weed as they can as quick as they can with the lowest cost to them as they can manage. This makes up the vast majority of what's offered as high quality weed. The vast majority of weed available is either indica or indica dominant because indicas grow a lot faster & trim up much easier compared to sativas & sativa dominant hybrids. But the difference and variety between (and in between) the spectrum of sativas and indicas is vast and rich.  Just very quickly for those that don't know already broadly speaking there's 3 categories of weed which can be described in general thus (there are exceptions of course): Indica which are short, squat plants heavy in cannabinoids that give a strong body stone with associated potential negative traits such as lethargy & ""couch lock"". Indicas are the choice of commercial growers & their common traits marketed as superior to others. Then there are sativas which are tall, lanky, plants that not only take significantly longer to grow (some take twice as long as your average indica) with airy, leafy buds that often do not have a strong smell & are a lot more difficult to trim than indicas requiring longer, more intensive labor. Sativas also are difficult, less hardy plants to grow that require either a lot of vertical space or a lot of care training the plants to grow in the space available. They are finicky eaters and can burn easily from too many nutrients in their solution. Sativas are on the other side of the weed spectrum and are THC rich which gives more of a ""head high"" and is more psychoactive.  All haze plants are sativas. Sativas are generally associated with the potential negative effects of anxiety & jitters. Finally we have hybrids which usually lean more to one side than the other but will carry any possible mix traits from the indicas and sativas they are bred from.  All this is to say indicas, sativas or hybrids are neither superior nor inferior to one another - it's all a matter of personal preference.  But since the majority of MJ sold is indica dominant it is indica traits that have nothing to do with bud quality that are touted as superior.  Each one of these commonly accepted ""truths"" are false:  1 - The best weed has dense, fat buds.  Dense fat nugs are marketed as the best weed because the vast majority of commercial growers prefer and pretty much exclusively grow indica/indica dominant strains. The only thing a fat bud will tell you is this plant likely has indica in it which is neither a good thing nor a bad thing, it's just a matter of what kind of high you're looking for. I'm not saying dense buds are inferior, our Bogglegum is a gorgeous, crystal-y, fruity bubble gum smelling eye catcher with dense buds, but none of those traits effect anything except appearance & smell. There are fat buds that have unpleasant highs, ones with excellent highs, some are potent, some are weak - density is indicative of nothing except the buds have indica in them.  Indica strains are very appealing to the commercial grower for several reasons, the first being that they flower much earlier than sativas & sativa crosses, taking 7-8 weeks as opposed to having to wait anywhere from 10 up to 16 weeks to harvest - that means in a year a bulk seller can make up to twice as many harvests if they grow indica plants.  Indicas grow shorter (much easier to handle, especially indoors), are more drought, pests and disease resistant, and are just generally less finicky to grow than the more delicate sativas.   Indica buds tend to be heavier and denser, thus making a more compact and heavy product.  Plants with that dense indica build also trim easily & quickly, they also take to mechanical trimmers much better than less compact & more leafy strains.  Add all that up and its clear to see why when looking at things from a profit driven point of view, indicas and indica qualities are heavily touted by commercial growers.  2 - You can tell potency by the smell of the bud.  Indicas are generally strong ""dank"" scented plants. But odor indicates nothing but that you have a strong smelling bag of bud on your hands. Terpenes control scent/flavor in MJ & have nothing to do with the compounds that influence potency: cannabinoids & THC.  A related myth is X scent is superior to all others, I've seen this mostly in regards to diesels. I remember seeing a gorgeous looking, fat budded plant, with a nice amount of trichomes (crystals) that had the strongest diesel smell I ever encountered. Alas this plant was no good for anything but breeding stock as the strain had an incredibly weak high which would require breeding with a potent plant.  This particular myth started out due to the preponderance of strong scented indicas but then became a novelty marketing strategy & just part of the bag appeal in it's own right as evidenced by the profusion of strains offering exotic fragrances from chocolate, to cheese, to fruits, to fuel, to spice, to pine and then some.  This is not to say smell plays no part in the enjoyment of the smoking experience, but it really has no impact on the high itself.  3 - The more sticky crystals on the bud, the more potent the smoke.  At first blush this seems like it makes sense, as those crystals known as trichomes are the parts that contain the active ingredients of cannabinoids & THC but more crystals are no guarantee of anything but pretty crystals - there are many, many ""white"" strains of mediocre potency and below average highs that are just teaming with snow.  It is entirely cosmetic with no effect on potency. Lots of crystals are pure marketing, it sparkles, it's pretty but there are snowy white strains that pack no punch and plants with few crystals that are extremely potent.  4 - Its hard to know if the strain name is correct.  Unless you are purchasing from a grower, or someone who works directly with a grower, you really have no way of knowing whether what you are getting is really what the name says it is.  This isn't to say that you are being lied to by the seller: they most likely were told ""this is the real deal sour D""  or whatever the flavor of the month is.  They don't know they were lied to and there is absolutely no way for the average weed purchaser to know with any certainty the strain actually is what they've been told it is.  You may have tried ""Sour Diesel"" before and liked it, but when you get it again its totally different.  You have no way of knowing if the first smoke was Sour D, the second, or neither.  The business is generally dominated by people known as ""flippers"".  These are guys (well, mostly guys   who purchase pounds, ""five-packs"" or ""ten-packs"" of bud, and see a slight markup when they sell generally receiving one or two hundred $ profit on each pound they ""flip"" to either another flipper or to an end retailer aka a dealer.  Bud can pass through many hands this way before it finally reaches your dealer, and all it takes is one unscrupulous flipper somewhere in the chain to hide the true identity of the weed.  That being said, there are different versions of Sour Diesel out there, offered in different forms by different breeders.  Strains that come from different origins/breeders but bear the same name inevitably have differences.  This is why we provide the breeder name with our strain descriptions:  we want you to know exactly what you are getting.  We also use breeders that have created highly regarded, unique & in some cases either famous or award winning strains which we grow, increasing the chances of using superior bud genetics which also means our strain names are accurate and meaningful.   All this obviously leads to...  So how do I judge the quality of my weed?  Now that the common myths & their reasons for being has been disclosed, where does that leave the buyers? How can you tell if a strain is any good? Unfortunately my best recommendation if you don't want to grow yourself is find a knowledgable, honest seller that knows these things, and can provide descriptions of the effects of their plants other than merely ""dank"" ""A+++"" or ""med quality"". Experienced growers & sellers who have the high as their main priority will know what makes amazing, unique smoke worthy of your time & money and can speak intelligently about it. If they sound like they aren't very knowledgeable, they probably don't know or care about selling you a product that gives you the best high they can give. Your order will likely be hit or miss. Do not hesitate to ask a seller questions, if they don't respond or say something that indicates to you that this is a person just trying to turn a quick buck, move on. Let the vendor know what you're looking for, a heavy indica is a vastly different experience from a sativa haze. They can steer you to the right strain or another vendor that may have something more to your liking.   Here are the basics of what really determines the best buds  #1 Strain/Genetics selection  Our Bogglegum is definitely conventionally attractive bud but we'd have thrown it in the garbage if it gave an unpleasant, weak or merely average high with nothing special to recommend it. The truth is the prettiest most photogenic buds tend to be average smoke or worse with a few notable exceptions. We chose Bogglegum because amongst growers it was recommended as great smoke (Bogglegum won us the last Silk Road 420 competition for best Hybrid) and as a bonus it smells nice and looks pretty. We grew them out, then we chose the plant that had the nicest high. There is variation even in strains that breed true so growers select carefully from the plants they've grown out - you can select for the high, for yield, for scent & all sorts of things. We at Angel Eyes always go for what we agree is the best high. We've thrown out entire strains and with them the months of TLC that we put into growing them out because they had negative effects we don't want to sell to our customers.  #2 Proper Care & Handling from Seed to Harvest to Drying, Curing & Storage  I was skeptical that MJ would be greatly effected by how it's treated from growing to storage. As you can tell by our selling point: our curing process, use of organics, after harvest techniques to control the character of the high & careful handling after storage & shipping, I've learned that the effects & potency of MJ is determined largely by how it's treated, after harvest as much or more than during growing. It goes without saying that curing & allowing the bud to mature and change is not compatible with commercial growers/dealers interested in high volume as it takes time and attention. See for yourself if you find yourself with some so-so bud, put it in a mason jar (if it's too dry, add a bit of an orange peel for a day, if it's too wet, leave the jar open until it dries to your liking). Give it a 2 week cure by storing it in a dark cool place (a drawer will do fine) & open the jar every few days for 5-10 minutes just to air the bud as part of the cure. It'll turn your average bud into something a lot better than you had two weeks ago!   Well, that's the straight dope on what's hype and what's real when it comes to marijuana from our growers, tenders & aficionados to anyone reading this. Hope that cleared the air some.  Sincerely, Ava",

After these harvests the next harvest will be ready in early July and will have more Big Lebowski, Grape Bogglegum, Kali Mist and Silver Haze.   On a related note, over the past few months orders have not flowed out as quickly as we (and our customers) would've liked.  To fix this I've brought one of my partners on to help with packaging and shipping.  This means we will be able to adjust our shipping schedule to guarantee shipping within 3 days of order placement, and more often within 2 days.  This policy will be instituted beginning with the new listings next week.  Here are the strain descriptions:                        )                      (         _____________ )        [_____________#   **************************************  Grape Phenotype Bogglegum - UV Dried Sativa-dominant hybrid (Bubblegum by Bog)  2-3 week cure  The Grape Bogglegum is for most of us our all-around favorite.  It can't be beat for its incredibly balanced head and body high.  Its an indica sativa blend, with very special qualities on both sides. This cure has a deliciously strong sweet and fruity aroma/taste and imparts an active head high that makes the world sparkle and fills the smoker with a wonderfully controlled energy and confident mood.  The body buzz is strong and definitely gets you stoned, but without the tired feeling of many strong body-highs.  It won't couch-lock you, or make you dizzy or dumb, and the high lasts a good long time.  The UV dried version of this strain is the one we sell.  It makes the sativa side better (removes some potential jitters without draining the energy) and also enhances the wonderful body buzz that is great for aches and pains.     The Grape Bog is our most visually beautiful and fruity sweet strain.  The buds tend to a light lime green with peach colored hairs and incredible numbers of trichomes that glisten and sparkle in the light.  The ""grape"" part of the name comes from the phenotype we grow, but in my opinion the grape aroma dissipates to a more general fruity sweetness after the buds dry, though some people say they can still smell the grape even then.  **********************  The Big Lebowksi (2-3 week cure) Indica/sativa blend.  Over the years, pot has gotten a lot stronger, especially with the advent of indoor hydroponic growing under metal halide and high pressure sodium lamps. The Big Lebowksi is a kind of a throwback to a mellower time before industrialized pot production. The Big Lebowksi is a happy, hazy high with a sweet sativa head and beautiful and stress-melting body buzz.   This strain is strong but it takes it easy with you in a way that many indoor strains don't nowadays.  It has a citrus spice taste that softens with a longer cure and is very smooth.  The Lebowski is a cross between Blueberry and the Cinderella99 Pineapple cut.  The C99 Pineapple is a true classic sativa that transports you to mellow yellow-land with a dreamy smile on your face, and Blueberry is one of the most famous classic pain-relieving strains around.  The UV-dried version of this strain really brings out the medicinal pain relieving Blueberry indica goodness.  The traditional dried version we refer to as the ""classic"" Lebowski.   ""Classic Big Lebowksi"" (2-3 week cure)  This version of our popular Big Lebowski strain was not dried with UV light, unlike our regular offering.  This is the strain as we first sold it and as many of us here at Angel Eyes prefer it.  Without the UV the C99 sativa side really comes out and is a more psychedelic and potent version of the plant, though the basic character remains the same.  **********************  S. Silver Haze Sativa haze, MrNice/Shantibaba  This strain has a fantastically cerebral high that stimulates thinking and reflection, and in higher doses is quite psychedelic.  As a sativa I'd be surprised if it weren't energizing, and it doesn't disappoint, but its energy is fully available to the task at hand, not being lost or wasted on secondary thoughts and impulses.  This Silver Haze has the clearest head of any strain I've ever smoked and it enhances the dominant voice in one's head and can help resolve indecisiveness or clarify internal conflict.  Its really great for motivation and work, and while you can kick back and relax on it, you probably won't want to.  I've noticed with a lot of pot that physical activity can wear out a high quite quickly.  Not with Silver Haze.  After an hour and a half of exercise I was still happy and high.  I would say the strain is a well balanced combination of euphoric and creative and provides an exciting high.  Super Silver Haze won first prize at the High Times Cannabis Cup in 1997, 1998 and 1999 and also won awards at the High Times harvest festival.   **********************  Kali Mist (Serious Seeds) Sativa  Kali Mist is a long-blooming sativa with an incredible spicy aroma and a super-potent head high that can literally blow your mind. The gossip surrounding this strain is that Kali was specially developed by a select group of breeders as a pain relieving strain especially for women. Its an odd story because sativas are not known for their pain relieving qualities. However, many women do claim that it is excellent for menstrual cramps, and our experience is that it does have an unusually strong and energetic body buzz.  The high Kali produces is incredibly strong.  Kali is a ""one-hit wonder"" with a quite obviously high THC level.  When taken in small to moderate doses, the high is lively, with an active head and strong visual heightening.  Its a very good strain for socializing and for working, but it can be a bit much for the latter if taken in higher doses.  Its also great for exercise and sports, and lasts a long time.  Kali Mist won the Cannabis Cup twice and placed once: 1995 - 1st place ""Hydro Cup"", 2000 - 1st place ""Sativa Cup"" & 2002 - 3rd place ""Sativa Cup"". In our opinion the awards are well-earned.  **********************   Cheers, Ava",

So after waiting about a week for my order it finally came in. I opened it up and really couldnt see what the hype was about. I had read so much on this and other forums about how amazing this vendor was. I sat there pondering, trying to figure out what exactly could have been so good about this bud. I mean, dont get me wrong the Super Silver Haze had more orange hairs then green leaves!, But still Ava in her posts always tells us that bag appeal doesnt matter so I couldnt let that sway me, even though the SSH was some of the most beautiful flowers Ive ever seen.   I picked up my freshly cleaned bowl, dumped some freshly ground SSH in and let it rip. One quick inhale and bam the flavor just filled my senses. It, it it tasted amazing. But, still I was determined not to be so easily impressed. I sat there trying to fight it off but I really was no match. You see for the past 8 hours I had been drinking in celebration of being done with finals. I was starting to feel hung over and knew I needed something to help ease me out of the pain, and the SSH definitely did that. My indignant drunk self, even after trying so hard to fight it off couldnt believe how amazing this tree was. A nice cloud full of energy erased the headache that had awoken me out of my drunken slumber at 1am. I was able to stay up for a few hours clear headed and able to accomplish a lot of physical activities in that short time span   . Well keep the details to the imagination; just know this haze is amazing.   So the next morning, knowing that I just wanted to sit around and not do much, I took it as a sign to try out the chemdawg x G13 cross I got. This strain definitely doesnt have as much bag appeal as the SSH but it tastes sooo much better. The smoke envelops your mouth and just chills it, kind of like a menthol cigarette but without any of the harsh burn on your throat. It definitely did trick, combined with some edibles I had earlier I was on full couch duties for the next 5 hours. I dont really know how this chemx13 is on its own, but the edibles that I had definitely didnt kick in for another 30 minutes. The chemdawg definitely delivered during that time, relaxing my body as I tucked myself into my couch ready for the laziest of Saturdays to begin.   Although it took a bit of time for me to receive my package Ava was great in providing updates through the forums. Im going to be a long times customer of AngelEyes, the flowers they produce would easily make me wait a month without really getting agitated. Packaging was very stealthy, kudos to AngelEyes for that. Im pretty sure at this point Im just adding to AngelEyess already impressive resume, but it is well deserved. Im currently hitting the SSH and its given me just the right amount of clarity to right this review. This would be a great strain to start your morning off, or to get some menial tasks done-> I just cleaned my whole apartment and it wasnt that painful because of this stuff. The chemdawg is definitely more of a chillout and listen to music/watch a movie strain. Im just rambling at this point, just know ANGELEYES ROCKS.  ",

To make you feel what I felt, and am feeling.We'll leave out the longish delay between the ordering and the actual receiving, due to some confusion about some unfortunate seeding Ava and the lovely other folks at Angel Eyes had experienced. It wasn't really that long, but I was dankrupt and that tends to streeeetch things out. Anyways, it came in the mail today, very ordinarily and with no fuss. Packaging was excellent, he said vaguely. But there was to be a small fly in my ointment, as you shall see. As I extracted the precious materielle from its shipping container, I noticed written on the outside of one of the innermost packages: (half what I ordered).Now, I had ordered (what i'd ordered). But I am looking at the extremely delicious looking and giant bud settling itself down into my stash jar, and what I'm thinking is - ""There is no way this is only a (half what i ordered) It's huge! Look at this thing! It fills my whole jar!"" But I was also noticing that it was not as densely packed as the last order I'd had from another vendor, a different strain. Maybe it is only (half what I ordered)... this might sour this experience a little. But I can't remember where I put my scale, so, a pinch into the grinder goes. Load up my vapor genie with a goodly looking amount, and start having at it. I can measure it later, minus ""a pinch.""Not very minutes later (clock time), but an eternity later in terms of my perception... many thoughts going through my head, the foremost of which was ""Hooooly shiiiiit. I don't even care if I DID get half my order by mistake. This stuff is out of this fucking world. This order here'll last me like... a nice long time."" I start picking up the various bags that are littering my floor, and go to look inside the box.THERE. IS. ANOTHER. BAG. IN. THE. BOX. I... I... feel like the luckiest man in the world. So! The HIGH! If someone asked me what a ""head high"" was, I'd hand this to them and grin from ear to ear. It is pleasant, and creative, perceptive... good lord, I think I almost went mad listening to someone using a vacuum cleaner downstairs before I figured out what it was. I'm still not even sure the sound was there at all, to be honest. This shit. Is. Amazing.Super Silver Haze? That's not the coolest name I've ever heard. But this could be named ""Blob of crap"" and I'd keep coming back for more. I could not be a happier customer.Thaaaank you thank you thank you Ava and other AngelEyers! WELL WORTH THE WAIT. WEIGHT?"

I've been doing a ton of reading this is what I did. First, I got tor and you did too or you wouldn't be here! Next, do this with your Tor browser  http://forumzxmoorof4ja.onion/index.php?topic=3.0. Now after you do this with your browser, you will not be able to access some sites which is a huge pain but better safe than sorry. Even after you do that with your browser, it's not enough. Get a VPN service that you have to pay for. Security aint free my friend. Now buy some bitcoin. I used lupojacks advice and got Coinbase. Get those coins in your real name from your real bank account.  it takes forever to get your coin unless you have a visa. Next, blend your coins.  http://bitblendervrfkzr.onion/?p=index Try here, you can get a free account. Now you will need a wallet (bitcoinwallet.com) you can get in a fake name with a fake email. I use hidemyass for email and VPN. Put your blended coins in your secret wallet then tranfer to your CR wallets. Not sure after that...have not placed order yet. I have read all kinds of stuff on PGP keys and found the easiest was using Igolder.com stupid ass easy and nothing to DL. Sent my first vendor message today so hopefully that went well. Just make sure you copy and paste your public PGP key in your account. From what I've read, never do business with vendors who use FE as the this site was designed to keep people honest but the digression will go to you after you get to know your vendor.   Now on your end, which is no problem for me, buy from Ebay. NOT amazon or anyone who will have designated boxes. Ebay or Etsy. I do this on a constant basis plus I had a business so I get shit constantly. Makes for better stealth with your post office IMO. I hope Ive covered most of it for you. As you do these things, it will become easier and clearer on how things work. Good luck Idontcare!",

I'd recommend using a non-windows operating system for your darknet activities.  I say this because windows is the least secure OS by far.  If you don't want to go the tails route, which is the safest (and probably easiest as well), you can get free desktop virtualization software from Oracle called VirtualBox.  You can set up a linux virtual system that runs through VirtualBox, download the linux version of Tor and you're good to go.  Also, it really pays to learn PGP.  It may take a little while to get the concepts and functionality down but there are a million tutorials on the darknet forums to help, and you can always ask specific questions as well.  Finally, before ordering from any vendors make sure to not just read their profile and feedback, but read through their forum review thread.  Its vital to do this last because feedback can be spoofed and unless you can hear directly from customers of the vendor you just don't know if they're a scammer or not.  As for FE, I wouldn't do it unless your vendor is trusted.  Even then there have been quite a few trusted vendors that stopped dealing from their vendor accounts and stole tons of coins on their way out the door.  That won't work on you if you don't FE.  Good luck and feel free to ask any questions you might have.",

As Lupojak posted before, I think reddit.com/r/darkmarketnoobs is a good resource to use.  There are FAQs and guides on how to do pretty much everything.  And, in my opinion, it may be overkill to use both a vpn and tor.  tor in itself is anonymous (of course, with possible holes as with everything else).  Your ISP knows you're using tor, but cannot see what you are doing.  Now, if you aren't using the best security practices for yourself (using tails, not saving anything locally, using server based encryption), then VPN is ok to add.  All I want to say is ""READ READ READ.  Understand before doing.  Ask questions if you need to - or read more""   With all that scary stuff being said, for smaller personal amounts it is unlikely they are going to go after you unless you live in an area where they want to make an example out of you.  Just try to keep a cool head about your dealings and be aware of what risks are where.   ","Hi Idontcare, PGP keys and found the easiest was using Igolder.com stupid ass easy and nothing to DL.

I think there may be some miscommunication here...  I thought a spliff was a large conical joint...JFC, I feel retarded. I've been smoking for over 20 years and I didn't know this?  I already know how to roll a (smokable, but not always pretty) doob in normal tube shape. I thought the tube name was a joint (bone, doob, J, etc.) and the conical shape was a spliff.  I appreciate all of your comments and will incorporate them into my technique, but I'm really interested in learning how to roll those big ol whale cock conical joints!  Don't laugh!

Not an easy skill to master.  I don't think I will be able to do a better job than a youtube video, but my one tip is to  PACK THE ENDS!  Gently packing in the ends of your joint after rolling (with a pencil, scissor tip, stem, etc.) will help you out enormously. Properly grind or cut up your herb, roll it into a paper that is at least  somewhat tight (I go from middle outwards with my thumbs several times rather than left to right), then fix all your loose pockets by stuffing in the ends.  Once you have packed in both ends of it, you will then want to gently but firmly pinch and twist the excess paper together. Move the joint in a circle as you pinch. Then, cut off the little excess paper dick. If your starting material was finely ground and of decent consistency this will result in a joint with no RUNS, no canoeing (if you light it properly anyway), and it will be very long burning with a rather high weed:paper ratio typically.   I do not use filters or cardboard crutches because I find them unnecessary when packing+twisting+cutting, as this creates a nice tight seal on the mouth end of the joint and herb doesn't fall out. It also allows you to pack both ends, which if you don't have perfect finger technique (let's be honest!), is the only way to make sure the entire joint is 100% consistent through and through. Otherwise you will have an area where there is slightly less weed than paper (a pocket), and when the flame hits that it will affect both your smoking experience by changing the smoke (more paper in that one hit), and also potentially cause a run in the joint (one area burning faster towards your mouth than another).  For learning how to roll I'd really recommend a big tray that you don't have to worry about dropping stuff off, and just get a bunch of material, and cut it up, and roll like 15 joints in a row. Talk with friends or watch TV or listen to some books on tape or whatever, but that's really the only way to get the skills I think.","Firstly, the only way you're going to get better is practice, lots and lots of practice. Keep going, every spliff you roll is another step on the road to the perfect spliff. If you don't want to waste weed just pick up some crappy rolling tobacco. Are you trying to roll cones or tubes? Tubes might be easier to start with.The real nitty gritty of rolling is spliff is the amount and distribution of your herbs. I think if you can't get this right, the rolling, tucking and licking is irrelevant. If you're rolling a cone then the herb needs to increase in diameter going away from the mouth end. If you're rolling a tube, then it should remain even throughout the paper. For either shape, if you're using a filter you need to make sure that the herb next to it matches it in diameter. When you're rolling the paper around the weed you should use a gentle touch, rolling up (away from mouth end) towards the tip.  I roll ""lefty"", which means I hold the mouth end (usually with a card filter) with my left hand, I think most people use their right, so switch it up if you're having trouble. Make sure your hands are clean and dry. Mix up the papers you're using, thicker/stiffer papers are easier to start with before you move onto super thins. If you're having trouble assembling the joint on a surface, then try using a rolling tray, or just fold up some card into an M/W shape, and rest the spliff in the middle during assembly."

I've also got a glass spoon pipe.  Sure does work but tastes like total ass.  I also get cherry bombs flying at me because I keep forgetting to buy a screen.  That being said, nothing gets me higher than smoking.  Sometimes that's what's needed and  I take one for the team when it's like that.  ",

Packing the ends is really what it's all about, I'l usually start a roll, then undo it and make sure everything is even, out to the ends (maybe even a little extra in the ends), then roll it back up until it's just right - you really don't have to get it perfect on the first try...   Recently, I started using one of those little machines (under $5). It also takes a little getting used to, but once you get the starting rotation going, it's a piece of cake and rolls a near perfect J. And you can make them a little thinner with a little practice (if that's what you like).   ","I don't think I will be able to do a better job than a youtube video, but my one tip is to PACK THE ENDS!"

That and lots of practice.  Also, pretty is nice but as long as it burns smoothly its a good jay.",

And to address your question GreyHulk, there really isn't a safe email provider.  Email as a communication medium is inherently unsafe.  It's how you sign up and use it that can offer you some level of protection.  Do not use an email account if you don't sign up for the account through Tor, and always check your mail and send mail using Tor.   And encrypt absolutely everything.  If you're using your ""secure""-ish email account, NEVER correspond with anyone that isn't doing the same.  Don't mix up recipients from your IRL insecure email and your semi-secure privacy protected email.  If yiou do you are totally compromised at that point.  If you accidentally access your email account without Tor, even just once, you should assume the email account is now 100% compromised.  Start over with a new email account.  And the person you are emaiing needs to take the same precautions.  Unfortunately, you have way of knowing if they are being safe.  Sure you can see if a message is encrypted or not, but you can't necessarily tell at a glance if they were using tor when they mailed it and you have absolutely no way of knowing if they were always safe with that mail account when they emailed other people.  So avoid email whenever you can.  And this should go without saying, but the CR message system and ""private messages"" sent through the CR forum are not secure communications in any way.  Encrypt EVERYTHING.  Please be careful everyone.  JackBlue  ","1.  What is their privacy policy2.  do the providers keep any logs3.  if they do keep logs, how easily they can be compelled to turn those over. "

I just want to make you all aware of a couple of things, (that you may already know). I have come across references to people using Safe-mail.net in several places and would just like to warn people away from it. Check out below:  http://www.deepdotweb.com/jolly-rogers-security-guide-for-beginners/are-you-using-safe-mail-net/  http://wanderthedark.net/2014/04/15/dont-ever-use-safe-mail-net/ The emails are not encrypted until after they reach the server so any successful warrant can recover clear text of what you send.  I think the future is in systems like:  https://protonmail.ch/ Currently they are not accepting new accounts because they were overwhelmed with demand but you can 'register' for a call back when they have upgraded their servers. These guys are from CERN in Switzerland and they started the project because they were freaked out by the interception of email traffic by security agencies. They have come up with a concept that no other email system employs at present as far as I am aware, the message is encrypted before it reaches their servers so any successful warrant will only receive encrypted files, and any such warrant is hard to obtain under Swiss legislation (they want to protect their banking industry). They check the validity of your application for an account so don't put something stupid like ""I wanna buy drugs""! Put a serious, considered and rational reason forward as to why they should accept your application, remember these people are physicists and academics. Also they are raising funds for their new servers through cloud funding, any small donation you can make will help to bring the project forward. As an aside to the funding route check out what paypal did:  https://protonmail.ch/blog/paypal-freezes-protonmail-campaign-funds/ I am not affiliated in any way to the people developong this system, I just think it is the future for secure, private email communication. As with many other innovations it may never fulfil its potential but we should at least give it a chance to flower and support it as we can. Now the the idea is out of the box I hope and anticipate that it will be duplicated by others, until that happens this is our best hope. Peace and love",

If the provider does have some logs and they have been turned over then your email address could be linked to the email address in question.  Even though they may never know the content of the emails they may pull you into the loop, especially if they see a pattern over many occurrences.   Tor would totally hamper them tracking it down.  I choose to avoid most but not all email communication because I do not have a real need at this point.  That may change at some point depending on situation.  Your key points are gold. Use tor encrypt everything  If anyone has been reading about any of the high profile darknet busts you'll see that law enforcement is catching on and sometimes an investigator goes to huge lengths to track everything down.   It makes for some scary reads that could induce some paranoia.  Good thing cannabis helps with that as long as you don't go overboard.

There was a very simple reason why many vendors and buyers from SR went to safe-mail after tormail was shut down.  I was not relying on their security.  I was relying on the fact that safe-mail allowed you to do several important things that very few providers allow:  1.  safe-mail allowed users to set up new accounts from Tor with no personally identifiable information and no alternate working email address required.    2.  you could also send and retrieve mail and log into your account from Tor.   Most email providers don't let you do either of those things.  I didn't matter at all whether or not safe-mail was protecting me.  I was protecting myself while using safemail.  If you must use email (and there are much more secure alternatives) make sure and follow those steps and be aware of the limitations of your privacy.  Most security experts agree that superior safety (and much easier conversation) can be had with instant messaging, specifically using the jabber protocol (xmpp) over either the pidgin or adium (mac) apps.  With pidgin, you also need to install the OTR (off the record) plugin -- it's built into adium, enable the setting ""require encryption"", and set the connection on the client to use the tor .socks proxy connection (127.0.0.1, port 9150).  Make sure OTR is enabled.  Not only is it probably much safer than email, but the encryption and decryption happens automatically making conversation a lot easier than with email.   if you have a riseup account, they have complete instructions on setting up OTR instant messaging on their web site.   Even if you don't have riseup, follow their setup directions but using any alternate jabber chat server instead of riseup.  Be safe!  JackBlue @jabber:    jackblue@xabber.de",

The classic joint does not even compare!  I've shown my setup to old school dogs who won't even like vaporizers and they fell in love with the shatter/pen combo due to the crazy stealth it can provide and the fastness of getting high.  I guess the price scares them a bit for 50-80 a gram of 80% thc pure shatter stuff.

I find them quite fun and reliable, the design is a bit different than the typical pen, I think the lights are a very novel idea. Other than that it's just a wick and a tube really, hard to mess up.  The upcoming syringes will be in two varieties: pure BHO (butane honey oil) and a BHO/VG (vegetable glycerin) mix. The pure BHO is, in my opinion, preferable in most situations. However some of the smaller vape pens, the ~600 mah batteries for example, don't do quite as good of a job with it as you'd hope. For those pens, I recommend using the BHO/VG mix, this makes the oil flow a lot easier, gives you a lot more vapor a lot faster.   The extraction is pretty standard medical-level stuff, vacuum purge and then a light heating purge for some decarboxylation also, no solvent remains in the pure oil.  I'm not sure what the thc/unit will be of the VG/BHO mix yet, but the pure BHO syringes are the genuine mind blasting stuff, no solvent or carrier involved.","Quote from: TheBestCannabis on May 12, 2014, 12:53:59 amI don't have access to name brand cartridges, but I sell refilling syringes for DIYers.

This in combination with some shatter like Domopost mentions, or a few dabs of BHO, is seriously effective.  I would also recommend you check out table top vaporizers for vaporizing flowers, such as the magic flight launch box, silver surfer vaporizer, volcano (high end), and others.

So far, really impressed with things here and looking forward to getting well established on Cannabis Road.  I've grown really weary of the constant agora struggles with uptime/availability.  It makes it difficult to run a business...""   Some get it on thier own, like the vendor above, who found their way here from battle fatigue;  while others:  ""thanks for the invite Im just not so sure if an all cannabis market is the best for a vendor I guess any market is good I dont know why I didnt check it out. mostly I like only checking 2 markets. Not sure the way agora is headed either or they just need some vendors to ease server load.""   are still on the fence but, will show up here eventually if serious about the cannabis market.   Perhaps with a cohesive recruiting effort - with a crafted message - that focuses on the major differences between CR and other markets, PLUS other incentives - they will show up sooner rather than later.  Also there needs to be incentives to make selling here more attractive when a vendor is splitting biz between CR and another market. One observation is that CR seems to get the short end of the stick based on a perception of volume. If a vendor thinks the customers are here, then they will make more products available.  ...just my .0002 btc.   *edit> it just happend to occur to me, a MAJOR selling point for CR how fast everything is compared to other markets..how everything just works...  I did an order on CR today, including 2 sends and a mix, in well under an hour. In the old days, that could sometimes drag out all day, or longer, depending on market uptime, lag etc.. Going elsewhere like onion shop or doing escrow free off market deals became a viable option for convenience.  The frustration factor thats inherent to agora (or other large markets) drives down sales. We should be able to assure anyone we pull over that CR has the backend and support capability to handle the increase in traffic.   *edit2> a convo on another market, with someone we worked with before, and after shifting a chunk of biz to CR in the spring, that illustrates the above point:   over here sniping vendors for CR.   happy to see you are doing well there   If you know any you could pull over i think they are offering bounties...  /jack   ""Ya, CR is great. It's so refreshing to vend on a site that has all the features it should and just kind of works all the time. I keep waiting for the bubble to burst, but so far so good.

","I'm very satisfied with my first TBHC order. I ordered a globe vape pen and syringe of BHO on July 22nd, and it arrived intact with great stealth on July 31.

The BHO is excellent, kind of a dark molasses color and squeezes out of the tube with a honey-like viscosity. When dabbed, the smoke and taste is great, and most importantly, potent as hell--you don't need much of this stuff to get ripped.

What does FE mean? Why are FE listings cheaper?   FE (finalizing early, or paying up front) and scammers go hand in hand and you should rightfully be wary of anything FE-related. However, you should be wary of handing anyone your money for nothing in return, and any third party is a potential risk, including seemingly reputable escrow services.   I offer a lower price on FE listings because from my perspective it hugely minimizes risk for everyone involved. If a market were to be seized by authorities, hacked, etc., all funds in the escrow could be lost. This is bad news for buyers and vendors alike, and no one who has been through this experience on a market wants to repeat it.  I don't want to scam anyone, I want to develop a lasting identity on the marketplaces. If I get bitcoin and an address from you, I will get you bud - period. I think of myself as a person of character and integrity and only try to associate with like individuals in all my endeavors.       Will you ship internationally?   No. I sometimes think about expanding to international shipments but not any time soon. Extra money doesn't help, sorry!      How long will my package take to get here?    3-7 business days from the time you order. From the time your package is marked as shipped it will typically take at least 3 business days, however in some circumstances, especially involving rural delivery or inclement weather, it is not unheard of for packages to take up to 7 business days from being marked shipped to arrive. I do not offer express shipping regardless of how much extra you are willing to pay. I aim to ship packages within one business day of processing an order, but I am human, and sometimes life-things get in the way. I will always, no matter what, prioritize your security and mine over speed. If absolutely necessary I will cancel your order with my apologies but I will never cut any corners to meet a deadline.     Can I have multiple strains in my order, is that what you mean by mix and match? Can I have 0.75g of X strain, 1.5g of Y strain, and 1.25g of Z strain?   You can have multiple strains in your order, however I would ask that you be reasonable with your mix and match requests. When people buy an eighth and ask me to split it up into three strains it is very time consuming and often leads to customers getting much smaller buds than they would otherwise receive. It is most convenient to mix and match amounts in 3.5g increments - i.e. splitting a half ounce up into four eighths of different strains.      How much for a pound?   I don't sell wholesale. The listings that I have available are all I will sell, typically this is nothing over 1-2oz amounts.      Can you send me 0.02 bitcoin? I am just barely short of ordering from you.   Unfortunately no. While you may be legitimate, this is a regular scam on the darknet, and I cannot send anyone any bitcoin. If you are in this situation send me a message about making a custom listing for you, but please be certain you actually want to purchase from me before doing so, it is tiring to set up custom listings for people who don't end up using them.     I want to get several ounces a week but I don't have bitcoin. Is there some other way I can pay you?    No. For your safety and mine there is no payment I will accept other than bitcoin.     Will you send me a package using Fed Ex or UPS or another carrier of my choice?   No I will not.      I ordered from you yesterday and I haven't heard anything from you yet, is everything ok? When can I expect arrival?   I do not typically send out messages to customers unless necessary. While it would be ideal to be able to send everyone a pre-written message at every step of the process (processing, shipped, etc.), it is not feasible for me with the amount of time it currently takes. Because of this I utilize the market's order designation system to keep customers aware of their order's progress. After I have seen your order and decrypted your address I will mark the order as processing - this means I am working as quickly as I can to ship your package out. Depending on how busy I am it may take as many as 3 business days (in rare circumstances) for your package to ship. Typically an order marked as processing will be shipped within 36 hours. After a package is shipped, it will be marked as such. Understand that in many cases a package marked as shipped late on Monday may not actually enter the mail system until Tuesday.   Ideally I will not have to send you any messages, although I am happy to answer any questions you may have.      Can I have tracking? It is extra important because ___________.   Unfortunately no. It is a security risk for me to share tracking with you.     Could you put xxxxx type of special item in the package so that if my ""room mates"" open it they won't think anything?   No. Stop ordering weed to your mom's house. I am completely confident my packages will pass through the postal system without any issue, your parents are a different story. I have no interest in mom-proofing packages. Buy your weed off the street like every other teenager until you have enough of your own money to get a PO box. ",

His guess was accurate as far as I can tell from the postage marks.  Stealth:    TBC's stealth is better than most. Multiple, different kinds of odor blocking bags are a given. Beyond that, there's clever labeling that matches how the buds themselves are packaged.  Stamps on a Priority Flat rate. Typed label.   Shipping:  Ordered Thursday, shipping Saturday, was at my door the next Thursday. A little slower than expected for priority mail, but that's probably not TBC's fault (Although TBC might consider shipping earlier on Saturdays to meet the cut off. My shipment was processed on Saturday but the timing suggests it didn't make it into the system-at-large until Monday.  Product:  Maybe it's not the best cannabis, but it's close enough that TBC can use the name. Large, fluffy bright green buds, lots of crystals and hair, sticky. My 1/8, 2 different strains, came in 2 buds.       Purple Kush is an awesome indica  I tried it for the first time after a long day of work and could feel each muscle in my back relaxing one at a time. Also puts me to sleep, which is what I'm really after.  With a daily smoking tolerance, half a trench of PK in a MFLB gets me to a 7+, YMMV.     Lost Coast: Also good shit, hybrid with sativa characteristics. Advertising makes it sound more sativa heavy than it actually is, but definitely a sativa hybrid all the same. Doesn't make me sleepy but I don't have the usual rush of energy and chattiness I get with something like PFM's Green Cheese.    ",

What customers don't take into account when considering stamps vs click n ship or other pre-paid options are that, even if the vendor has acquired that account anonymously, your package is now linked to all the other customer's packages that vendor has decided to ship from that account. Ever. I feel a bit uncomfortable even going into this type of detail, and I especially don't think this thread is the place for it, but rest assured every possible stealth issue you can think of I have thought about for 10x as long. Stamps are not the easy way out, they are the ideal way.  I certainly understand the viewpoint though, if you are unfamiliar with anonymous shipping practices you are only looking at it from one perspective, and a package with stamps certainly stands out a bit more than one with pre-paid printed postage.    Thanks for the continued excellent reviews everyone.

","Quote from: MisterOtis2 on August 02, 2014, 10:42:32 pmI'm very satisfied with my first TBHC order. I ordered a globe vape pen and syringe of BHO on July 22nd, and it arrived intact with great stealth on July 31. He threw in three replacement heating coils to compensate for the slower than average shipping time (and I didn't even have to ask). The BHO is excellent, kind of a dark molasses color and squeezes out of the tube with a honey-like viscosity. When dabbed, the smoke and taste is great, and most importantly, potent as hell--you don't need much of this stuff to get ripped. My understanding is that this particular oil is a mix of strains, but to me the effects felt very indica-like. I'll be using it at nighttime to relax and send me off into a nice deep sleep.  Are these items available on the CR website? I think I see the pen that you're describing, but not the BHO thing. Not really sure what that is, but sounds like some kindof hash, or oil. I'm not really sure how this whole vape thing really works anyway, but was wondering if this rig is a good starter set? Does it have a smell when using?"

Lupojack is correct about TBC's use of stamps, as TBC explained.  Furthermore, I would NEVER knowingly buy from a vendor who uses click-n-ship (as TBC explained) and any buyer who knowingly does this is playing with fire, which is not smart since this whole business is about mitigating risks...which is why stamps are the best option.  There are so many things that a vendor can do with your address that are unsafe, and using click-n-ship is near the top of the list.  That's nearly tantamount to advertising to everyone that he/she is storing ALL addresses!  And why would you want to send your info to that kind of vendor?

TBC sent me a message confirming my order very promptly.  Package was shipped the next business day.  Took five business days to get to the Eastern US.  Package was unassuming.  Properly concealed with absolutely no outward signs of the treasure inside.  I'm no drug dog, but I couldn't smell anything until I opened the last of several layers.  I got one ounce split four ways.  Weight looks heavy, but I don't have time to confirm with my scales.  Visually there is some slight compression of the buds, but that just comes with the business of shipped cannabis.  Smells are fantastic and distinct for the different strains.  Lots of trichromes (I'm already drooling thinking of the kief that'll accumulate in my grinder).  I'll post again once I've had a chance to try some which should be in a few days.  Price is spot on, in my experience, even considering I went with the traditional escrow and not FE.  All in all, I am very pleased and will be back when I have more need.    Cheers!  GU",

The best way to do this review is to start out with a shout out to TBC for his amazing communication. Within an hour of ordering with him he sent me a message. There was a mix-up with my order that was completely my fault and he reached out immediately. Grade A service. Once everything was cleared up I see that everything was shipped out the next day. I had Fed and am really glad I did. I received my package in two business days, much quicker than I had expected. I had ordered 3 different strains from TBC and some oil, and everything came clearly labeled and packaged with the utmost care and stealth.    A quick review on the flowers. The OG was nice, but honestly wasnt spectacular. Ive been fortunate enough to have tried several different batches of OG and this one was in the middle of the pack. Dont get me wrong, I rolled a joint of it and it kept me grounded while watching a pretty dramatic and depressing basketball game. However, as a quick aside I tried some of the oil after the game was over and I was on my ass afterwards (oil is a must try). I was still upset, but dramatically less so. Anyways, the OG was good but my least favorite of the three.   The Chocolope Skywalker was a cross I couldnt find much information on, but I really liked this strain. The buds are beautiful with a deep green peppered with brown flakes all around. I had perused the pictures of the strains beforehand, and this one looked much better in person. The smell is intoxicating and its just loaded with crystals. Out of the three this ones bag appeal is on a whole different level. The high is very relaxing but uplifting. I was able to try this one out as my first introduction back after a two-week break and it was amazing. It started out with a strong body high, then its followed by a rush to the head. You will see what I mean if you get to try this one out. This strain tastes great, I cant put my name on what it tastes like->probably chocolate but I dont want to be stereotypical and say that.   Anyways, the Maui Wowie is what Im currently smoking on and is about on the same level as the Chocowalker in terms of its high. This one hits you straight in your face and stays in your head. Youve got a rush of energy but you dont really want to run, although mental activities seem like they would be a lot of fun (definitely should play a video game or play chess or something mentally strenuous). This strain taste great, with notes of fruit and looks good too (although the Chocowalker wins bag appeal easily). I saw that TBC ran out of this one, and Im sad but if and when its back Ill have to get some.   TBC definitely gave me exactly what I had asked for, even though it was a custom order. This guy is great and has been an all around amazing vendor. If you get the chance definitely try this guy out.  ",

Communication N/A: Didn't feel the need to make any inquiries, 1ndica's profile and listings make sense.   Product: 5/5: This isn't tippity-top shelf, but it has been taken care of. The weed matches both the pictures and the strain description on Leafly (tons of orange hair). The sealing process hasn't compressed the buds too much, if at all, so they still have all of their bag appeal (my 2gs came as one big bud).   The effects: A gentle body high, pain relieving, with a relaxing and blissful head high, good for the evening time or after a hard day at work. Feels like drinking cocoa in a hot tub.   Hopefully this trend of more domestic UK vendors continues, I'm enjoying having options. It might be cheaper to order internationally, but nothing beats that next day delivery feeling.

Personally i would like him to get a genuine cheese cut,ideally suicide but pyschosis would also be great.  Would be interesed in any top shelf strain,sativa doms seem to be better at handling disease but would consider anything.  Saw only one person and to be straight his prices are way high,all growers chuck thousands of branches out,to stick 3 or 4 in some clonex and a jiffy cube then mail it isnt rocket science and 100 bucks a clone just seems like profiteering to me.  So if anyone can/would/will be able to offer something at a more sensible price it would be most appreciated by two desperate UK stoners!If there is no joy here if anyone can point me in the right direction that would also be very kind.  thanks for taking a look folks.",

MBB and double vacuum seal. 5/5  Weight: insanely heavy.  I ordered 7g of each strain and received 10g of each! 5/5  Product:   The Lotus Dream has a real nice light green look and it is tric'ed out.  very light smell before you crack a nug which is enhanced once you break one open.  Not the freshest flower however and I think this impact the smell somewhat.  The Lotus Dream are tight nuggets and I have a preference of a little more spindle looking flowers and less what look like mass produced tight nuggets.  You mileage may vary with this remark but its my review..HA!  The buzz indicates to me a sativa dominant flower which is decently potent.  Again, a personal remark and I am sure others will get whacked by this flower.  I did not but it was a pleasant buzz and I would give this strain 4/5 grade from an overall perspective.  4/5  The Alien Grenades is darker in green color then the LD and looks, smells and hits like more of a true hybrid.  Buds look decent (for the record, I think the Dream Lotus have a nicer appearance) and the smell is again good, not great.  Nuggets are dense like the LD, maybe a tad denser.  The buzz sets in for me to the body first and then relaxes the mind.  Not a very psychedelic weed and certainly not a creative buzz but a very good relaxing strain.  4/5  In summary, both strains are good value, especially when you add in the extra weight DDG provided.  One recommendation I would ask of the DDG is a better photo or photos of his flowers and a more detailed approcach to describing the buds from a bag appeal/buzz report perspective.  I asked some questions about bag appeal and buzz report and although DDG answered all my questions, I was left scratching my head a bit.  I would love to see the head stash of these flowers DDG has... I could imagine that some of the plants he keeps for himself, if they were cured in a small batch way (8 week jar cure!) would look, smell and hit amazingly.    I recommend DDG as a reliable vendor with very good flower at a fair price.  DDG is very generous with the weight as well and this needs to be said considering how much the added weight enhanced the value of the overall purchase   ",

What I've learned....(threads split and merged),Cannabis Road Discussion/General Discussion, That is my exact technique as well!  I usually do 1 long inhale to fill my lungs with a grouping of three 2-3 second button pushes and then I fill my lungs at the end no matter what(since your lungs absorb the most when completely flexed).  Tasty hits every time!  As soon as I taste a hint of harshness I know its time to refill!   Cleaning these things has been OK.  Annoying but doable with enough iso baths and a little scraping with a qtip carefully to get the nooks and crannies.  Right now I am also working on turning concentrate in to liquid enough form for a tank.  I purchased a small amount from tzzht and it works well so I figure I'll try and make my own using EJMIX purchased from  www.liquidizer.com.  I think Gentlemen's brand also sells mixture to turn concentrate in to liquid for a tank.  I'll report back after I experiment more.,"Thanks tech2014alpha!  I was one to get in on the w9tech sale that originated from the other thread.  I've been loving it.  I had only tried a cheapo globe that ended up only tasting like burning plastic and obviously didn't like that.  In the titanium kiss cart I do not have that problem unless I'm running dry or too long.I don't have a variable output mech mod, just a push button and it works.  I find that starting a slow inhale, hitting the button about 2-3 seconds, releasing, continue inhaling, repeat the button press. eventually stop inhaling and hold.  As long as the button isn't pressed too long everything is cool.  great hits and flavor.  go a hair over or start getting dry and it is very noticeable that 'something ain't right'.Thanks for posting your knowledge about this.  I'd have given up if I tried a bunch of carts on my own.  Quote from: tech2014alpha on July 26, 2014, 10:45:55 amW9TECH Titantium Kiss Carts have titanium coils and ceramic wicks.  I can use one 3-5 fills per day of a small 1/2 pea size dab and it will last a week before starting to get really dirty and need to be soaked in 90% iso or everclear.  Let is dry well.  Don't dry fire these things and only hit the button for 1-3 second burts during a hit. Do not scorch, just vape.  Think small hits not huge gutbusting hits. The second you get an off flavor that is harsh it means you let the cart run too dry. STOP and refill a little bit.  They like to be fed small bites and never let run too low.  You'll make the coil last longer this way. "

What I've learned....(threads split and merged),Cannabis Road Discussion/General Discussion," I tried pulling the wick out of several coils.  It completely ruined it and couldn't get any hits.  Direct coil on wax with no wick just wasn't working right and it would melt and leak out.  But this was with the china stuff.  Plus silica is just not good for you.  The w9tech stuff uses 609 threads so puchase a 609 to 510 adapter if you want to use your own batteries.  It ads about 1/2"" to length.    I put a small chunk of shatter on the coil this morning, and I swear I got 10-15 nice rips from it each one as smooth as the last and tasty!  Not a wint of anything burning or nasty like all the rest.  Titanium coils are amazing!  And a non silica wick is also awesome!

I don't have a variable output mech mod, just a push button and it works.  I find that starting a slow inhale, hitting the button about 2-3 seconds, releasing, continue inhaling, repeat the button press. eventually stop inhaling and hold.  As long as the button isn't pressed too long everything is cool.  great hits and flavor.  go a hair over or start getting dry and it is very noticeable that 'something ain't right'.

Escrow and FE discounted listings available!  Hey, CR community! We were recently give permission by the admins here to open a vendor account! We are currently in the '100~150 deals' category on Agora with 4.99/5.00 feedback rating and we've also reactivated our presence on Evolution where admins there have added our legacy sales and granted us FE permission - although we will always be having a slightly higher priced escrow option. Feel free to message us if you have any questions! =)  Anyway, we currently have some pretty fire outdoor Sweet Kush! Nice earthy and sweet smell, tons of orange hairs and ample visible crystals! Nugs range in size from medium to HUGE!  1 oz. - $175 (FE discount), $200 (escrow)  1/2 oz. - $95 (FE discount), $110 (escrow)  1/4 oz. - $50 (FE discount), $60 (escrow)  Limited supply so grab them while they're available! =)  Additional info. from out profile page:  SHIPPING  All packages will be shipped via USPS priority mail with a tracking number. We charge an extra $7 to cover shipping and packaging expenses. We're going to try our best to ship within 1 business day of you ordering. As of now, we're only shipping packages Monday-Thursday; any orders placed Thursday night through Sunday will go out Monday. The reason being is that we want to avoid packages being held up longer in the postal system through during weekends.  ESCROW  While we will be having FE discount listings, if you choose the higher priced escrow listing your order will be 100% protected via the escrow system. But no bitch shit guys! As soon as the package arrives we expect you to finalize IMMEDIATELY. We can't afford to have bitcoins tied up in escrow AFTER packages have been delivered since bitcoins are so volatile. Users who don't finalize on time will be on our blacklist.  REFUNDS  We use USPS tracking labels on all our packages. If the package shows as delivered, there will be no refund. Do NOT use fake names on addresses, USPS will not deliver and we will not be held liable for that!  Other than that, feel free to message us with any questions! We'll do our best to reply as soon as possible. :-)  Also, PLEASE use PGP when placing orders!",

All users must upgrade as soon as possible: this release fixes numerous security issues.  Changes  Notable user-visible changes include:      Security fixes         Upgrade the web browser to 24.4.0esr-0+tails1~bpo60+1 (Firefox         24.4.0esr + Iceweasel patches + Torbrowser patches).     Major new features         Spoof the network interfaces' MAC address         by default. It can be disabled in Tails Greeter.         Rework the way to         configure how Tor connects to the network         by using bridges, proxies and restrictive firewalls. This option         can be set from Tails Greeter, and replaces the old         experimental ""bridge mode"" feature.     Bugfixes         Additional software: do not crash when persistence is disabled.         Upgrade Pidgin to 2.10.9, that fixes some regressions introduced in the 2.10.8 security update.         Wait for Tor to have fully bootstrapped, plus a bit more time, before checking for upgrades and unfixed known security issues.         Disable the Intel Management Engine Interface driver. We don't need it in Tails, it might be dangerous, and it causes bugs on various hardware such as systems that reboot when asked to shut down.         Add a launcher for the Tails documentation. This makes it available in Windows Camouflage mode.         Remove the obsolete wikileaks.de account from Pidgin.     Minor improvements         Upgrade Tor to 0.2.4.21-1~d60.squeeze+1.         Upgrade obfsproxy to 0.2.6-2~~squeeze+1.         Upgrade I2P to 0.9.11-1deb6u1.         Install 64-bit kernel instead of the 686-pae one. This is a necessary first step towards UEFI boot support.         Install Monkeysign (in a not-so-functional shape yet).         Disable the autologin text consoles. This was one of the blockers before a screen saver can be installed in a meaningful way.         Don't localize the text consoles anymore: it is broken on Wheezy, the intended users can as well use loadkeys, and we now do not have to trust setupcon to be safe for being run as root by the desktop user.         Make it possible to manually start IBus.         Reintroduce the possibility to switch identities in the Tor Browser, using a filtering proxy in front of the Tor ControlPort to avoid giving full control over Tor to the desktop user.         Incremental upgrades improvements:             Drop the Tails Upgrader launcher, to limit users' confusion.             Lock down sudo credentials a bit.             Hide debugging information.             Include ~/.xsession-errors in WhisperBack bug reports. This captures the Tails Upgrader errors and debugging information.             Report more precisely why an incremental upgrade cannot be done.             Various user interface and phrasing improvements.         Don't install the Cookie Monster browser extension.         Add a browser bookmark pointing to Tor's Stack Exchange.         Remove the preconfigured #tor channel from the Pidgin: apparently, too many Tails users go ask Tails questions there, without making it clear that they are running Tails, hence creating a user-support nightmare.         Use (most of) Tor Browser's mozconfig.         Rebase the browser on top of iceweasel 24.3.0esr-1, to get the certificate authorities added by Debian back.         Give access to the relevant documentation pages from Tails Greeter.         Hide Tails Greeter's password mismatch warning when entry is changed.         Persistent Volume Assistant:             Take into account our installer is now called Tails Installer.             Optimize window height.             Display device paths in a more user-friendly way.  See the online Changelog for technical details.  Known issues      Longstanding known issues.  I want to try it or to upgrade!  Go to the download page.  As no software is ever perfect, we maintain a list of problems that affects the last release of Tails.  What's coming up?  The next Tails release is scheduled for April 29.  Have a look to our roadmap to see where we are heading to.  Would you want to help? There are many ways you can contribute to Tails. If you want to help, come talk to us!

If your public key is valid and clearly listed, there is no reason he should not be able to send you a message, and you make it sound as if you have decrypted messages from him successfully at least once.

Here is what I have done so far with setting up and using pgp -  1. Downloaded gpg4usb programme and created my key pair, Backed up copy of my private key.   2. Copied the sellers public key into notepad and saved it then imported it to gpg4usb and it now appears on the right hand side on the screen below my key.   3. I put my public key on my profile.   4. I type my message in the clipboard thing on left hand side of the programme then I click on the sellers key and hit encypt. I copy this into CR message to seller.   5. Seller replies to me and I copy and paste it into gpg4usb programmes clipboard. Hit decrypt and I am asked for my password. Enter password and bingo I can read sellers reply.   So my question is what I am doing wrong that the seller cannot contact me via his. Would it be he does not have my correct public key?  I must mention that I originally created a key pair with another pgpg programme GPG4win but I read gpg4usb easier to use so created new key pair with it. Seller had my original public key but I sent him new one and made sure correct one is on my profile.   Sorry for being a complete noob but want to make sure I get this important step right for all concerned. I've read a few noob guides and watched few video guides but my tired stressed brain is melted!   Thanks in advance to any kind souls     Respect and peace.   Gak",

We are not professional photographers, or even very good amateur photographers. But do you know who kicks ass at taking photos? You! Yes you! Do you want to take photos for us for a chance to win up to an OUNCE of weed? With free shipping of course.  For the next 6 weeks, we will be running a photo contest. To enter, simply:  1. Buy some weed from us  2. Confirm your order with BudCentral or myself  3. Wait for your order to arrive  4. Take a photo, or more than one.  5. Remove EXIF data. If you do not already know how to do this, it can be done as simply as pressing print screen while viewing your photo, and pasting into paint or your normal art application, and pressing save.  6. Upload to imgur or info tomb which can be found here:  http://infotombjhy7tcrg.onion/  7. Post photo url to /r/budcentral or send it to me in a PM and I'll post it on a cumulative thread on /r/budcentral for the shy ones.  Prizes below:  1st: 1 ounce of weed  2nd: half ounce of weed  3rd: quarter ounce of weed  Winners will be determined by the boss and I, although popular vote will be a significant influence.   Our own internal weed lottery is still running as well, in which each purchase of 1 ounce of weed incurs 1 chance to win, a QP incurring 4 chances to win, ect. The prize of it also being 1 ounce of weed. This is in addition to the photo contest, and sponsorship of the monthly raffle.

Shipping  seemed like it took a while, but all in all it came no faster than expected, but no slower either! 5/5 for that! Vendor was communicative, which is one of my harshest points of contention with many vendors. SSA has this on lock! No problems with waiting for comms 5/5! I agree with Butteron that the stealth could have been better. Honestly, just another layer of MBB would have made me feel more comfortable 4/5. As far as the product itself. It did  not look like what is pictured in his product listings, far from it. The product was quite brown, without much odor. The product ground up nicely, but was harsh on my throat when smoking it. My wife and I couldn't seem to get much of a buzz from it, however, and that was disappointing. My BIL was over at my place when we tried it, and he only smokes a few times a year due to his job. He said he didn't get anything from it either. I don't know what happened, I see SSA has buttloads of completed transactions and high reviews so I know he isn't a bullshitter sending out bunk samples. This time however something went wrong and I got very sub-par buds. I'm conflicted to write whether or not I'd order from him again. On one hand, my single, personal experience with him has not been stellar, on the other hand, the large quantity of high reviews for him and his product make me want to reconsider. Oh well...I promised him an honest review.  ",

It was an accident so severe that the then 11-year-old boy suffered bleeding in his brain.  For the last three years, Trey has struggled with headaches so severe that his parents say he was suicidal. Muscle spasms gripped him. The pain was nothing less than excruciating. Traditional medication wasn't working.  ""It's not fair,"" Angela said.  After getting advice from a doctor and researching medical marijuana, the Browns traveled to Boulder, hoping for a chance to turn Trey's life around. They say new friends gave them the cannabis oil they took back to Minnesota. It began to work.  The Browns are not alone.  ""We are seeing more parents coming in, inquiring about medical marijuana,"" said Justin Staley of Mile High Medical and Recreational Cannabis.  He says there are several reasons why people would to medical cannabis.  ""I think people are dealing with loved ones and are looking for a holistic, non-toxic option,"" Staley said. ""Something also that's not expensive.""  But in Minnesota, medical marijuana won't be legal until 2015. When authorities learned Angela was giving Trey cannabis drops, they charged her with two misdemeanors, including child endangerment.  ""I'm not a bad mom,"" Angela said. ""I was just a desperate mom who wanted to help her child.""  The Browns say they took their story to Facebook, where they received an outpouring of support. Now, a lawyer specializing in cannabis law has agreed to represent them, pro bono.  Angela adds the experience has been so difficult, they are considering moving to Colorado.

We want to sell anything and everything cannabis related. If you can find it legally somewhere in the world, you should be able to buy it here. We believe that marijuana prohibition is a tragedy against humanity. It makes absolutely no sense to us that a plant, that occurs naturally in nature, has been banned around the world from being consumed and cultivated despite never once even been proven to link to a single overdose. Marijuana does not ruin lives, prohibition does.   In the United States, there are people serving life in prison for possession of marijuana under the three strike law. We are seeing progress with Colorado and Washington legalizing the possession of marijuana, with Colorado being the front runner and openly selling it in stores. We hope this can spread around the country and later the entire globe, but until that time, we need a place where vendors can share their product with the world, and thus we have Cannabis Road 2.0  At Cannabis Road, we don't allow anything other than cannabis related products. This includes, but is not limited to cannabis, cannabis seeds, hash, oil, candies, etc. We do not under any circumstances allow anything other than cannabis related products being sold on Cannabis Road. No weapons, no child pornography, no forgeries, no fraudulent or stolen property, etc. We are a strictly peaceful, and pro-cannabis market that wishes to see the rise of cannabis like we saw the rise of alcohol during the previous era of prohibition.   We believe this can be achievable if enough people are willing to stand up for this and realize what a chance we have to make real change here.   With that being said, I welcome you to Cannabis Road 2.0! -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----  iQIcBAEBCgAGBQJTDcRVAAoJEJCe7EFgyAP6K1QQAJZO6+KNqHZ4gWWhAEzrEKdn LLFxsPdBv9D+vliP+Zpjm77p+Y9b2sm9EgJQgvBJ3m8UMC1nnaf/5wlDZsl/BI9H vPzdqllXgfoiFwR7PEUT63LwnYgBeS3/brOaLWgNPwcDz5QJi6X43rUJ/JOuNlXq bI2LS6ZJc0h1bhb6fwYUA46yhLUkXD0pv+lzl4AF3o8V2H76LSOs43uDhPOXBEqT s9VqCU6QmLiDF8Xpgib8KZxIO2jAsxbw0V5uSm/+r8nHT6f0xNafnLYC9bDN3lF5 RQogA+/Wdxnj4c6OQrenpX3avVmgV01lur0vZQH58XlZ3L8k1hugqGhV6bySgzZe o598h1MzAP5T2AsQLi5dYXxtyK1kPVylC9jsUTAlXmCB6t6HfjKHGf56t88p53gl mRDW2/jckRt57GWbmRkA3ZZb9XLFanp9X3EpOuiDV8Rr4nxJpyVaKPlsOIKF2SjV fFl//+807zFZ4nY8B3OpSrHABh4+pKgZBwuk1jXjX9uw1OjuGY2+TNwR4xetzdx7 D3P54KO1VwDuKC64URjCIPdGavLMkZbxbTSxZBpQTqHOYrCVX7Uq3EMoWftxT++k Dum1DeuCV51/FmT9xJoLOxQkLDWfNcq5oNmd19ojW/q5tv23y2cWzZ3Rudmo9uOH 4RJ/4/HfdqrHSr7Ag8wi =OVc/ -----END PGP SIGNATURE----- ",

Any market but evo,Cannabis Road Discussion/General Discussion,"I'll give my 2 cents even though most of these vendors have already been named.  From what I have heard from reviews ECC, JackBlue, and AngelEyes are probably the top here on CR for just quality but for that reason they rarely stay stocked for long generally a week. I haven't ordered from them as when I'm low I rarely see them with listings.  TheBestCannabis has great quality in reviews I've read as well, but also is a bit pricier but just like in real life, you have to pay for quality!  Dr. Greenthumb has been my goto guy as the bud is very good especially for the price. As a regular smoker for a long ass time its not the best stuff I've ever smoked, but for the price it definitely is. Stealth and shipping times are also top notch. Usually the better stuff is a bit pricier I've bought Sour Power and AK47 cross. SP was danker but pricier the AK seems like his main strain as its usually in stock and generally the cheapest. Again, for the price its awesome. Red, dank, smelly, no seeds, etc. but if you're looking for the top of the top notch you'll want to go with a pricier strain.

Communication: 5/5 - I had some questions before my purchase, so I sent a message to DA and received a reply in less than an hour, and it was pretty late at night. DA helped me make an order that catered to my specific needs, as I've been dealing with some health issues, and prefered a strain to help relieve certain symptoms. For me, this was beyond good customer service, this was like having a conversation with a friend, who knows much much more than I do. Nothing but nice things to say about DA's communication. Everything is PGP encrypted, and I appreciate it. OpSec is important, DA knows this.  Stealth: 5/5 - Not going to go into much detail, but all bases were covered. We all know how we want to receive packages, and DA doesn't disappoint. Zero smell until final protection was opened and WAAAABAM! it'll hit you. Buy with confidence, DA packs appropriately.  Shipping: 5/5 - 3 days to me is pretty much standard, past 5 days and I worry. I wasn't expecting it until Monday, but was happy when I received my gift on Saturday. Package was packed appropriately, with nothing on the outside to draw attention.   Product: 5/5 - As soon as I opened the last barrier, and smelled the sharp piney aroma, I knew I was in for a treat. None of the nugs I got were compressed. All nugs were of nice size, none were much smaller than a quarter, though nothing larger than a half dollar. I would say they are all consistant of size. You can tell whoever was trimming this bud, they took their time. Stems are not an issue and sadly, not a single seed was found! Nothing but quality smoking flower. This is the first time I've had Jack Herrer, and I'm by no means a connoisseur of cannibus, but this is quality herb. Vaped a bowl in my VG and sat on the back porch for an hour undistrurbed and enjoyed my time relaxing with nature. I'm not all hip on the different effects of different strains, but for me, I had no discomfort or any anxiety, just a strong relaxing sensation. Highly recommended!  Bonus: 5/5 - I was fortunate enough to receive a bonus in my package! I'm a big fan of edibles and smiled ear to ear when I unwrapped a high grade bud brownie. I just ate a quarter of it, as it's quite girthy, and it is super chocolatey. Strong chocolate taste, great flavor, a very welcomed gift and a nice treat after a bowl of chicken noodle soup!  Overall/TL;DR: 5/5 - Great communication, fast shipping, appropriate stealth and amazing product. I am a big fan of DiagonAlley, and the entire experience that I had. You do pay a premium for quality herb and service, I couldn't complete this review without mentioning that. There are cheaper sellers out there, but none of them have given me the service and the quality that I received from DiagonAlley.

Everyone on CR/DNMs should know PGP so this shouldn't be a problem. Respect his wishes...hes' ensuring your and his safety. The extra 10 seconds is worth it.    Shipping: 5/5 - Spent 1 day in processing (possibly the only vendor on CR that I have ever seen use processing) and was out the next day. In transit time was the longest I have ever had for a DNM order, however, that was no fault of the vendor, but rather my local post office. More info in the communications part.    Stealth & Packaging: 5/5 - As vendor states, MBB 2x. Zero odors. Printed labels. Correct amount/useage of stamps. Discreet and blends in well with other mail.    Communication: 5/5 - This is the most contact I have ever had with a vendor over a transaction. Thanks to my local post office marking the DC several days early, vendor and I stayed in touch and kept each other updated several times over the course of 3 or 4 days. Every time that I sent a message to him, I had a prompt reply. From my communications with this vendor, you can tell that he cares.   Now to the product...DiagonAlley is a new vendor to CR and shot me over a small sample pack of his 4 current blends. He also requested if possible to snap shots and compare them to his for verfication that WYSIWYG, although I must say his pictures are better than mine.   First and foremost - These are true Cali buds. Many of you will know what I mean by that. Also, I am a daily smoker, so if you have a low tolerance, a few of these may hit you pretty hard.    GREEN CRACK: Sativa - Very strong headbuzz. Very smooth smoke. About 5 minutes after toking this, I went out to my garage to try and find something...Every 5 miliseconds while standing at my tool box I forgot what I was looking for. Definitely a ""do something"" smoke. Overall this is a great smoke for the daytime or when you want a good high, but don't want to be stuck on the couch eating cheetos.

Very thick and dense bud. Exactly what I mean when I say you can tell that it's Cali bud. I wouldn't recommend hitting this and then trying to pay attention to something, like a TV or video game. You will find yourself ""bored"" with just sitting on the couch. Fuck, I got so baked off 2 hits and then sat down to try and watch a TV show and almost gave myself a fucking panic attack because I was fighting my brain to calm down and enjoy the show but it wanted to think of 6,000 different things I could/should be doing.

Good for couch lock, watching a movie and becoming completely entranced with it, but miss the ending because your eyes got too heavy and wake up 2 hours later with the dvd splash screen repeating over and over and over and over.

Good joint rolling bud. Labeled as an indica, but you can tell that there is some sativa lineage because it doesnt' completely knock you on your ass. This is a relaxing night at home, not sure what I want I want to do but I want to be high while I do it type of smoke.

Also, I forgot to ask the vendor if mix&match would be available, but I would imagine if you're looking for M&M, that they would do their best to accomodate you.   Overall, impressed with both the vendor and the product and have been added to my ""Recommended Vendor"" list. ",

The other option if you want to avoid BitAddress or BrainWallet is to use Bitcoin QT which uses compressed keys by default.  The way you do it is, open up the debug console in Bitcoin QT and type   getnewaddress - this will generate a new address  Then type;  validateaddress [enteraddresshere]  And it will give you the public key. And finally you can get the private key by typing;   dumpprivkey [enteraddresshere]  By doing all three of these, you will have an address, compressed public and private key.  And all of those can be done OFFLINE with Bitcoin QT.   Hope this helps.","I noticed that Electrum generates an uncompressed public key but this site uses compressed public keys.  Is there a way to convert the key in electrum to compressed?  Or, would i have to go through brainwallet.org and type in my passphrase for my Electrum wallet and let it generate a compressed passphrase from there?  it's odd that the Electrum wallet doesn't properly generate, or so it seems, the uncompressed address either, i.e doesn't start w/ 04 as described in several tutorials.  I'm VERY new to the multi sig process and I've gotten this far and have funds in the Electrum wallet and have sent money to the market to start the transaction just got hung up at this step.  Would love the help as maybe I can pass the info along to someone else in need.  Thanks folks!"

Given its alleged use in drug trafficking, money laundering, terrorist financing and other anti-social activities, a number of states across the globe have warned consumers about the risks involved in relying on and using the decentralised money.  Now, a group that claims to track the activities of government organisations around the globe alleges that the popular cryptocurrency is a project run by the US National Security Agency (NSA), whose reputation has been hit by the revelations made by whistleblower Edward Snowden.  The group, named CIA Project, claims that bitcoin is made by the NSA or the CIA. However, the 'evidences' the group presents lack depth, potentially making it a conspiracy theory. CIA Project's main proof revolves around the name of bitcoin's alleged creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. The group says a white paper on bitcoin was released in 2008, and it was reportedly written by a person named Satoshi Nakamoto, which roughly means ""Central Intelligence"" in Japanese.  The team added that Bitcoin Forum, a bitcoin community where Nakamoto used to communicate, usually removes posts connecting bitcoin with CIA. Raising suspicions about his identity, Nakamoto has never left even a single personal identification clue in his numerous posts on Bitcoin Forum over the years. CIA Project alleges that this shows 'intelligence training'.  In addition, Gavin Bell (aka Gavin Andresen), who is the public face of bitcoin, claims that he has been communicating with Nakamoto for many years. However, Gavin has neither met Nakamoto nor spoken with him on the phone even once. Nevertheless, the anonymity of the alleged bitcoin creator, Nakamoto, cannot be viewed a valid point to base the claim. In addition, Nakamoto is a common Japanese name, and the group's arrived translation is coincidental.  Another evidence the group is trying to bring is related to the source code of the digital currency. It says the common programme used by most cryptocurrencies to create secure keys is suspected to be back-doored by the NSA, citing a ""recent WikiLeaks document"". Bitcoin did not use the most popular programme to create secure keys, and the fact shows that the NSA already had full information about bitcoin, according to the group. ""While bitcoin believers portray bitcoin as a new decentralised currency, the command structure of bitcoin core development is 100% centralised,"" CIA Project says.  The claim could be refuted as bitcoin's source code is open source, and therefore the NSA need not put a back door in the code. The programme that bitcoin uses to secure transactions, SHA-256, is created by the NSA. The open source programme is said to be one of the most secure algorithms in the world.   <end>",

I would suggest you take some quality photographs of your product with your vendor name in the photo. Then spend some time making a nice advertisement for your product - write a good description, using proper grammar and spelling. Look at other successful vendors selling a similar product for examples. Offer a few small free samples to people who will write reviews for you, and then ask those people exactly what they are expecting. Your customer's feedback will quickly become your most valuable tool for improvement, should you choose to utilize it.   If at first you don't succeed, try try again. It can be very daunting at first when sales are only barely trickling in, but if you stick with it and believe in your own capabilities you will be rewarded eventually. In comparison to many other business opportunities, it is still rather easy. Typically you would expect to not make any profit at all for the first year of a start-up, on the darknet that is cut down to a tiny fraction.","Well I had my account running nly a week now & not made 1 sale.

Like 1/8 = $30, shipping $8.  That way at a glance we'll know if vendor charges shipping and how much.  If you are trying to choose between 2 vendors this may make a difference.  I know you can drill down to the actual listing to see this, but I've found myself more than once clicking thru to see they charge high shipping (international vendor, etc) 2.  same view I think having an icon for escrow type or multisig would be nice.  I know many, myself included, haven't done a multi-sig transaction yet.  3.  can there be a few different views?  maybe like it is now, plus a list/details view that shows columns populated with data regarding the listing as above.  I'm thinking of an explorer type view that is like windows/linux file/folder views ""basic, detail list"".  Sorting by column would be great.  Order status change tracking:  1.   Document order status changes and be able to display them when looking at the order details. (at the url like  http://cannabiskofvl7pa.onion/my-order-detail/x/x).  I'm currently trying to work with a vendor on a delayed package and having information like order time, acknowledged/processing time, shipped time documented would be nice.  Misc:  (I'm sure you could make these as complicated as you want - with alert management, creating new alerts, etc.    These are more *it would be cool if they could do that* type items) 1.  keyword alert feature - be able to setup an alert that watches for certain keywords that the user can enter.  that alert would be set once, modified later, etc.  The alert could look for things that you would like to be notified on if a vendor lists it.  ie, ""trainwreck"" and when a new item gets listed since your last logon it could display an alert on your home screen. 2.  vendor new item alert - have this in mind for ECC and can see it being beneficial for everyone's own favorite vendors.  If a favorited (manual action by user) vendor posts new items then show an alert on home screen.  I hope I don't irritate you with all the feature requests.  I'm trying to make this place HOME!    ",

I'm more than happy to share my experience with TSG because almost nothing was amiss.   Packaging & Stealth  4.9/5  Packaging was done extremely well. Tamper evident parcel arrived in great shape with absolutely no odor. The stealth was awesome. I could have opened this up in front of anyone and felt confident doing it. Just an phenomenal job of masking the odor, texture and true nature of the parcel. Other than the handwritten addressing I couldn't ask for more attention to detail.   Shipping  5/5  Super fast shipment!! Only one day passed between the item being marked shipped and arriving at my location. Total time from ordered to Delivered is 4 days, 3 if you only count normal delivery days.   Bag Appeal  5/5  Nice trim on a very dense and frosty group of nugs! Little orange hairs peeking out from everywhere, can't wait to get into this bag.   Aroma  5/5  Very sweet, fruity and pine aroma. The smell seems to bounce back and forth between a light fruit and a strong pine scent. This is definitely what it's supposed to be, that smell is classic Blue Dream, and I already know it's going to be potent   Smoke  5/5  The flavor of the smoke is true to the aroma, starting off with light blueberry notes and ending on an enjoyable pine taste. Full head and body high within the first 10 minutes, but no couch lock feeling. The scent in the air is very pleasing and strong. Beware of smoking in public spaces as this will attract moochers and/or law enforcement.   Vapor  5/5  Vaped at 365F(ARIZER Q), produced a nice thick and milky vapor with immediate head effects and a slowly rolling body high that felt almost like a massage. Mind is focused while body is calmed. Very relaxing and thought invoking. Slight couch-lock after two bowls.   Potency  5/5  Effects set in quickly and last between 1 and 4 hours depending on how much you ingest. True to the scent and appearance, this is strong enough to please any veteran but it's calming properties also make it possible for newcomers to enjoy without much worry.   Vendor Overall  5/5  For a new vendor on CR, TheSecretGarden is doing a lot of things right. I never needed to contact them and that's always a plus to me. They already offer help to new-coming vendors and have a high quality product, great stealth and fast shipping. I definitely plan to order from them in the future and I highly recommend them based on my experience. ",

The traditional method of making butter/ghee/oil is just to put the herb in the oil and simmer for a long time, this accomplishes more than enough decarboxylation. This also leads to a very green butter with a fairly strong ""pot"" taste in the brownies, which is why a lot of edibles these days are made with concentrates for a more refined product that tastes less weedy. I could offer both varieties, traditionally made whole-plant style, and ultra potent BHO butter.",dont you have to decarboxylate the herb in the oven or something?idk just going on what i have read...

The butter/oil mix is extremely potent and highly concentrated, and you simply use it in instead of the butter/oil that is called for in a baking recipe. Most store-bought brownies take about 2 cups of butter to make, and 2 cups of this stuff will make each brownie a quad+ dose.  Theoretically, I could be sealing up small amounts of this butter/oil mix. Is there any interest for this product, or does everyone just want already made brownies?  ",

There are 2 good ways to buy bitcoin. 1: Localbitcoins.com - lets you buy bitcoins from other people in your area. It is an awesome service but is usually quite overpriced (at least for me). 2: expresscoin.com - lets you buy bitcoin via cash (not sure if cash is available in canada). Specifically for canadians you can use INTERAC to buy bitcoin. It usually takes 1 day for the bitcoin to be in your wallet.  PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is an end to end encryption software. Basically when you create a ""key"", you get a public and a private version. You give the public version to people that want to contact you. They use that public key to encrypt whatever they are saying, then send it to you using whatever (it is a string of numbers and letters). Then, to decrypt it, you need your private key. You use the private key + a password you create and it decrypts and shows you the original message. More info:  http://forumzxmoorof4ja.onion/index.php?topic=2.0  Common mistakes are as follow:  Not using your real addressNot using your real nameFEing (finalizing early)FE - finalizing early - FEing is the act of releasing the funds in escrow before you actually recieve your package and verify everything is there. NEVER FE, PERIOD.

If you can't find answers to your questions in their topic threads we'll be here to help, and welcome once again!",

So that's why I've ended up here. What I hope to accomplish with this post is to get directions on what I need to read and understand to make sure I don't make some kind of rookie mistake. Feel free to post links or drop a message, I'm not very familiar with the terminology so go easy on me     What are some must read posts/articles/websites when it comes to understanding what bitcoins are and how to use bitcoins to pay someone?   What are the best ways to exchange regular currency for bitcoins ? (I am located in Canada).   I noticed that under my profile there is a blank box marked PGP, from lurking on the forum and reading it on a few vendors profiles I guess this is some kind of security measure, what do I need to do to generate one of my own?  What are some common mistakes people make when buying for the first time?  Last but not least and probably a stretch, is there a guide or walkthrough from beginning to end that someone has made that describes the process from shopping to purchasing from a vendor?

Opened - odorless. Extremely well odor-proofed. And now I entirely understand that the guy who left feedback before me said his envelope was opened but not seized... Now getting to the White Satin, I ordered 1/2 a gram and received 1g   Always a good start   Looks great - full bud. Not the strongest smell (But standard for the weed roads I'd say) Tastes delicious. Mellow and soothing high. Excellent medical relief full muscle release, and very enjoyable high.

Then you can insert a link to the pic by choosing Insert Image from the editor.   3. Then Post, and the pic will show up in the thread. Disable javascript if you so choose.  Hope that answers your question.    *Also...not to be critical, but if anyone posts pics in the thread - either directly or for download - for the sake of screen real estate and bandwidth conservation, how about resizing pics to a screen appropriate resolution?

On rare occasions we've had customers tell us our weed came to them wet.  Since we fully dry and cure all our buds, what probably happened is that the buds were a bit dry and we moistened them with the lemon rind trick, and maybe went a bit farther than we planned.  Then when we bag it for shipping the moisture in that small space spreads evenly through the buds and comes out feeling soft and perhaps even damp.  With that kind of wetness, leaving them in a paper bag for a few hours is all it takes* to get them right where you want them, at which point you drop 'em in the jar.    *that's assuming the air in the room is not particularly humid.  In hot, humid climates/seasons, your best using an air conditioned room for additional drying as the a/c dries out the air.  Otherwise your buds can wind up wetter than when you started  .  +1 for a cool thread @Acid_Wrapper.","i put it in paper bag and then  let it sit in room temp or a bit hotter for  a couple of days, the paper kind of wicks the moisture out of the weednever jar damp weed it can  start to grow mold unable to see with naked eye but not good for your lungs"

It could be the vendor trying to get a little more weight but i doubt it. If you find the product drys out too much i suggest cutting up a orange into slices and taking 1 orange slice peel and leaving it in the jar with your buds, continue to burp about every 2-3 hours until your happy. Your product will come out perfect, believe me.  La de da waiting on a vendor account :p",

A bunch of his recent reviews (but not all) complain about dampness or improper cure.,"Name the vendors and save the rest of us the time/trouble/expense.  To me, that doesn't sound like just under-cured weed, it sounds under-dried or re-wet ... either of which are prime starting grounds for mold and poor-quality smoke/grind.  The process starts with properly drying the herb (slowly) to a smokeable level, and THEN starting the curing process by sweating it in half-filled jars over a few weeks."

Do they snap at all if you bend far enough, or can you basically take a small stem and bend it so far that it touches itself at the other end? If the stems snap but the bud itself is wet and spongy, then the weed was at least properly dried and has just picked up moisture from being left open in a humid environment. If the stems are still very pliable the weed was never properly dried. If the stems don't snap I would personally immediately hang the weed up on a line and actually dry it out until they snapped. When there is still moisture trapped in the stems you are opening up the possibilities for mold to grow and other really undesirable business.   What humidity level, roughly, is it where you are keeping the weed? If you are inside a building with central a/c or in a dry/hot area your humidity is probably quite low. If your humidity is low (<%40), you can simply leave the weed out for a few hours per day and it will dry within two days most likely.   I wouldn't recommend messing with silica but it will work in a pinch I suppose. If the stems are dry but the flower is spongy, silica will be fine for sure.",

The weed is what I expected and wanted in every way except the cure. The buds tend to stick together as one mass, feel wet and are somewhat spongy. I had a hard time grinding a smallish nug in my mostly-clean space case, and the weed did not want to cherry without liberal lighter application. All classic symptoms of under-cured weed. Normally I wouldn't be worried since I usually pick up multiple strains at once, and can afford to leave a portion of my stash to cure while I smoke from a different batch. However this time both portions need to dry out more. I was thinking of putting a silica gel pouch in my jar, but I don't want to improperly cure it at this point. Any thoughts or suggestions for what I can do to remove this excess moisture? I'm not sure I want to wait a few weeks to complete the curing.",

THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP - make sure you hit the button that says encrypt address right below.  After you hit that you just finish your order.  You can check your order status on 'my account' - 'my placed orders'.  Your vendor of choice will then mark your order as processing- meaning he sees it and is geting it ready, and then, finally, he will mark it as shipped, meaning your order is in transit.  Most vendors will use priority shipping which will almost always arrive at your hours in 2 or 3 days after being marked as shipped if domestic.  Post carrier will just put the box in your mailbox and you're good to go my man!",

This is normal and most Marketplaces also have the 3 confirmations requirements. Once you make your deposit you then just wait for the funds to be cleared.  This generally takes about 30 mins but depending on whom is sending your BTC it could take several hours, and as previously advised you can check your BTC deposit address on the site: blockchain.info for number of confirmations.

Do females have structures forming at the nodes?Also I'm back to my 13w CFL as my 26w seems to have burnt out. For now I've moved it close to plant B, but it's got a ray shining at a leaf of A.

Seedlings will vegetate for at least a couple week's before beginning to flower regardless of light cycle, and the penetrative ability of your CFL is very very low, so having a taller plant is not particularly helpful to yield. You may see people with CFLs and small plants doing a 24/0 veg cycle, but that is likely because they are using clones. When you take a clone (cutting) from a mature female plant, it already has the hormones in it to go into flowering almost immediately. With a seedling, those hormones do not develop at all for several days. If you take a cutting and put it in 12/12, it may end up being a tiny little 4"" tall bud-stick. Seedlings though, even started on 12/12, will often reach 12"".  Without seeing pictures it is hard to say, but will also mention if they seem to be getting taller too fast this may be a symptom of weak light conditions. With a CFL, you want the top leaves to be as close as possible, we're talking less than an inch being ideal. If your light is too far away, your plants will actually (very counter-intuitive) stretch upward even faster because of the weaker light. However this is not desirable as it makes them spindly and weak.   12 on/12 off for the entire life of the plant if aiming to grow seeds under CFLs in my opinion.   Great to see you guys growing your own, it's a rewarding hobby.","All I did to start mine was to take a regular drinking glass, fill it about 75% with water, drop a couple seeds in, and let it sit for a day and a half. So far I've had pretty good luck, 100% germination of the seeds I've tried.I've got mine growing indoors, under 1 CFL, I'm a coin mining closet lol.My second plant (about 2 days behind the first) seems to be producing a scent now.  They just keep getting taller and taller... Been 24/0 mostly, but I did 23/1 for 2 days... Not.much difference.It seems that they are beginning to drink more water now."

If the cat gets his fix you get yours;). And the reason AfrikaSun seeds are so resilient because he sells outdoor bud. The strains he offers are all meant to grow outdoors in harsh conditions and sometimes uncertain light cycles. It will probably produce even if you water it with battery acid(just kidding).

Or would it be better to just grind the leaves and make oil (if that's possible)?","Males will have clumps of those not-quite-ball type structures at the nodes.  If you see clumps of more than one bump its male.  If you see a single bump with two very small little white hairs (pistils) coming out of it its a female.  Honestly, you still have time as the male won't start to develop pollen for a while and the female is not fertile yet anyway, so keep the light on both of them until you're sure."

The thing to remember is that with CFLs you have to reduce your expectations for bud size.  You'll get mostly ""popcorn"" buds, but don't let the size make you think they won't be nice smoke.  Bud size has absolutely nothing to do with potency.","The bigger plant is getting bigger, and it has more leaves branching out now.The shorter one is developing much slower, probably because it isn't in the middle of my pot.None are flowering yet, even though it's been exposed to as close to 12/12 as I've given it.It's been about a month since they germinated."

By doing so you are putting the vendor, customer,and CR at risk and helping our adversaries get one up on our community.   DO NOT post any details related to shipping methods whether they are good or bad. If a vendor uses sub par methods the buyer is encouraged to contact  Crypto. ASAP  The faster the better.

Secondly Kush is usually an Indica strain. Indica contains higher amounts of CBD than it's larger brother Sativa. CBD causes a relaxed feeling, used to combat pain. Due to it's smaller size it is ideal to grow inside, which makes this an easier plant to get hold of in countries where it's illegal, like the UK.

I'm wondering if I should've done more or not, but later when I tried to sleep, I just couldn't sleep lol. Overall the weed itself is a bit stealthy, since it smells a bit like catnip (actual catnip), but a cat can tell the difference lol.  I'd definitely recommend using a grinder, since otherwise you've gotta use your hands, and this stuff is just a lot easier with a grinder.  Has anyone been able to sleep after smoking Swazi kush?

Though I have noticed when making some weaker things, there was a bit of a high, then it goes to being tired. The last time I got that high though (before I made those firecrackers), was eating 2 hash gummies I got from that 'other road' lol. The vendor said it was sativa/indica... Sativa dominant. Of course this was a lot cheaper   And now I'm wondering if I should buy Swazi Kush... Anyone received it and can tell me how many seeds it had? And how much you bought?",Mamaka is said to be pure sativa. Probably you were just really high and any strain is gonna get you

Probably you were just really high and any strain is gonna get you     I'm no expert and just got back into smoking regularly a few months ago. What I read said indica are more of a body high or ""get you stoned"", good for vegging out and sleep, while sativa is more ""get you high"" and better to be active and social. Also, indicas have more CBD and I am going to split this with my buddy who actually has pretty serious anxiety problems and other health issues.. really needs it as medicine. I've got to talk to him and get some coins, but I think we should do two orders, one being a bit closer geographically because we have been out for way too long now.  Edibles really interest me for wanting to sleep vs. smoking though. I think I only ever ate once a long time ago. I try not to eat sugar and carbs though so going to look at making a butter or oil or something.",

Thanks pothead I appreciate that. A lot of former black hat hackers are recruited by these very agencies after they are busted for hacking. These same people use drugs.    Cannabis certainly doesn't mess with my ability to program, and in fact can put your brain in the ""zone"" where you become  one with your code. Ava, I'm sure knows about ""the zone"" when she is looking after her ladies.   Even Snowden said that the majority of NSA workers are well meaning people, and it's just a few senior officers at the top who are abusing the system and making ridiculous policies of dragnet surveillance.  I personally believe the majority of police officers and government officials do have a conscience, but when you join these agencies, you have to sign confidentiality agreements to never leak any information and to follow orders. Projects like Tor make these disclosures possible, and just goes to show you that mankind is good deep down, but the ones who run mankind are inherently sociopaths.","a lot of those people working in those agencies like to use recreational drugs as much as anyone.Recently the FBI/NSA had to stop screening for cannabis in potential new hackers for hire after they realized the best hackers/programmers are potheads, and all had weed in their system and failed their drug test. and it could be true take Crypto for example....A computer genius who loves his pot..;Absolutely true.  I have a few friends that went to MIT and I spent a summer up there with them and their computer-geek brainiac friends.  They were all inveterate stoners to the core.  They built the biggest bong I've ever seen out of a, it must have been 40 gallon, glass jar they obtained from I don't know where, a chem lab or something.  Some of them have given it up but most of them still partake in quantities that would put me out.  There's nothing like toking and falling into some computer code head first, or so I'm told.The funny thing is that if guys like that went to work for the NSA they'd just as likely be undermining them from the inside.  Stupid NSA.  Fuck 'em."

However, not everybody at the NSA is on board with this strategy. Tor developer Andrew Lewman says even as flaws in Tor are rooted out by the NSA and British counterpart GCHQ, other agents from the two organizations leak those flaws directly to the developers, so they can be fixed quickly. He said, ""You have to think about the type of people who would be able to do this and have the expertise and time to read Tor source code from scratch for hours, for weeks, for months, and find and elucidate these super-subtle bugs or other things that they probably don't get to see in most commercial software."" Lewman estimates the Tor Project receives these reports on a monthly basis. He also spoke about how a growing amount of users will affect Tor. He suggests a massive company like Google or Facebook will eventually have to take up the task of making Tor scale up to millions of users.",

Received 3 days later, without Sunday, it would of been 2 days. Doesn't get much better than that! Stealth: 5/5 Typical stealth, not gonna give details, but no smell until final layer, still just brownie smell once I opened the vac bag. If anything would be suggested, it would be to add decoy packaging, but for the size of this small order, not real worried about it Product: 5/5 I enjoy edibles as often as I can get them. Taking this into account, I ate half of one. I'm not sure how so much chocolate could be stuffed into a piece of a brownie, but wow, mad chocolate lol Very slight cannabis taste but mostly I tasted chocolate.  An hour after eating half, with a banana and some milk, I was at that stoned level where I find myself staring at the TV without really paying attention. Overall solid buzz for 4 hours, which is really what I expect out of a brownie with my tolerance. It was less head high and more body buzz, but over all about 4 hours of being stoned.  Overall: 5/5 Solid comms, fast shipping, acceptable stealth and a solid product. Thanks Babykale420!   ",

Making it less profitable to grow the best weed for growers.   A big time myth. I have four strains sitting in front of me right now, and the most potent is rated at about 24% thc and is the  least smelly of them all. The  MOST smelly has about 12% thc and has the lowest amount of thc in the group.    Again that 24% strain I have is probably the least sticky out of the four and doesn't look as frosty either.   When I was growing up, people always told us everything was ""kush"" in order to sell it to us for a better price. And when you think about how many times weed has to change hands before it gets to you, who knows what the actual strain's name is?  Thank you Ava for sharing this very informative post with us. It's amazing how many of these myths perpetuate throughout the years by anecdotal reports and rap music.    Some of that real sticky icky icky ewwwie! put it in the air!","Each one of these commonly accepted ""truths"" are false:1 - The best weed has dense, fat buds.;2 - You can tell potency by the smell of the bud.;3 - The more sticky crystals on the bud, the more potent the smoke.;4 - Its hard to know if the strain name is correct."

Ask any seller & they'll tell you how the weed business is so thoroughly dominated by bag appeal, smell & traits that have nothing to do with how you feel when you smoke their wares. It's driven by sellers of commercial MJ seeds, commercial MJ growers & dealers and perpetuated by buyers that just want to be able to discern quality weed from crap. I speak as a former ""blind man"" who only found out what's what by accident & by learning from wise growers. I'm gonna break down the falsehoods & provide explanation of their origins where possible. Before I go further I want to add this caveat to this post: this is not to tar as ""bad"" any particular type of seed breeder, growers or strain type.  My sole intent is to shed light on the differences available to people & help explain some of the reasons behind the average consensus on MJ.  I think it would be of the most benefit to start with the most pervasive and accepted myth about how to discern the good MJ from the mediocre or the plain bad.  The hands down best marijuana I ever smoked was at a New Year's Eve party, it's easily the best high I've had before or since. I was just sitting against a wall when the fellow next to me asked if I'd like to do a jay with him & since I was getting tired of the party & feeling kind of irritable & annoyed so I figured, what the  hell. To say it was transformative would be an understatement - I went from half asleep, annoyed and ready to go home to pleasantly alert & awake. It worked it's ways subtly & expertly as if some master was guiding the high for me. I'll broadly put into words some of it: it was the first high I ever had where I was able to have a clarity of mind without any trace of jitters, paranoia or anxiety but still with enough psychoactive THC in it to make everything feel magical & interesting without overwhelming my head. It just put a bustle in your hedgerow  .  Combined with a very pleasurable opiate like body high, which stood out in stark contrast to the anti-social stone I'd come to expect that always left me ""burnt"" or couchlocked & stupid with the negative effect lasting for about 3 days after smoking what I and everyone else thought was ""the good stuff"". It was unique (I remember I was able to make music in my head which would have any effect on me I wanted & I chose to make music to make me giggle to myself) and very different from all my previous experience with MJ up to that point. It was like being under a fairy's spell. Even the comedown was pleasant with nice hazey overtones coming into the picture.   The surprising part is it didn't look, smell or smoke like what I thought I knew quality MJ always looked and smelled like. In fact it was some of the humblest looking bud I've ever seen. It bore no famous name, he just referred to it as ""Thai stick"" which at the time and place was a generic term used for a range of weed regarded as low- mids, really anything that wasn't called ""hydro"" or ""kind bud"" which was supposed to be superior to this unimpressive looking stuff in every way. It was just plain old brown weed that didn't have a particularly strong smell or a designer smell - no diesel fuel or any ""exotic"" scent at all, it just smelled like weed. The buds were airy, leafy things. I was sure it was semi-shake ditch weed before I smoked it. Boy was that a revelation. Haven't had better since.  Which brings me right around to the biggest and most pervasive myth of the business which is that the best weed is crystal covered fat nugs that have a pungent smell. This myth didn't just spring up randomly, it was and still is pushed by dealers, commercial growers and the seedbanks & breeders that cater to them who make up the vast majority of the marijuana market. When I say commercial grower I refer to growers who largely deal in high weight. Angel Eyes is more of an artisan's collective where the goal is to make the best not necessarily the most profitable business. The commercial grower's business model is to move as much weed as they can as quick as they can with the lowest cost to them as they can manage. This makes up the vast majority of what's offered as high quality weed. The vast majority of weed available is either indica or indica dominant because indicas grow a lot faster & trim up much easier compared to sativas & sativa dominant hybrids. But the difference and variety between (and in between) the spectrum of sativas and indicas is vast and rich.  Just very quickly for those that don't know already broadly speaking there's 3 categories of weed which can be described in general thus (there are exceptions of course): Indica which are short, squat plants heavy in cannabinoids that give a strong body stone with associated potential negative traits such as lethargy & ""couch lock"". Indicas are the choice of commercial growers & their common traits marketed as superior to others. Then there are sativas which are tall, lanky, plants that not only take significantly longer to grow (some take twice as long as your average indica) with airy, leafy buds that often do not have a strong smell & are a lot more difficult to trim than indicas requiring longer, more intensive labor. Sativas also are difficult, less hardy plants to grow that require either a lot of vertical space or a lot of care training the plants to grow in the space available. They are finicky eaters and can burn easily from too many nutrients in their solution. Sativas are on the other side of the weed spectrum and are THC rich which gives more of a ""head high"" and is more psychoactive.  All haze plants are sativas. Sativas are generally associated with the potential negative effects of anxiety & jitters. Finally we have hybrids which usually lean more to one side than the other but will carry any possible mix traits from the indicas and sativas they are bred from.  All this is to say indicas, sativas or hybrids are neither superior nor inferior to one another - it's all a matter of personal preference.  But since the majority of MJ sold is indica dominant it is indica traits that have nothing to do with bud quality that are touted as superior.  Each one of these commonly accepted ""truths"" are false:  1 - The best weed has dense, fat buds.  Dense fat nugs are marketed as the best weed because the vast majority of commercial growers prefer and pretty much exclusively grow indica/indica dominant strains. The only thing a fat bud will tell you is this plant likely has indica in it which is neither a good thing nor a bad thing, it's just a matter of what kind of high you're looking for. I'm not saying dense buds are inferior, our Bogglegum is a gorgeous, crystal-y, fruity bubble gum smelling eye catcher with dense buds, but none of those traits effect anything except appearance & smell. There are fat buds that have unpleasant highs, ones with excellent highs, some are potent, some are weak - density is indicative of nothing except the buds have indica in them.  Indica strains are very appealing to the commercial grower for several reasons, the first being that they flower much earlier than sativas & sativa crosses, taking 7-8 weeks as opposed to having to wait anywhere from 10 up to 16 weeks to harvest - that means in a year a bulk seller can make up to twice as many harvests if they grow indica plants.  Indicas grow shorter (much easier to handle, especially indoors), are more drought, pests and disease resistant, and are just generally less finicky to grow than the more delicate sativas.   Indica buds tend to be heavier and denser, thus making a more compact and heavy product.  Plants with that dense indica build also trim easily & quickly, they also take to mechanical trimmers much better than less compact & more leafy strains.  Add all that up and its clear to see why when looking at things from a profit driven point of view, indicas and indica qualities are heavily touted by commercial growers.  2 - You can tell potency by the smell of the bud.  Indicas are generally strong ""dank"" scented plants. But odor indicates nothing but that you have a strong smelling bag of bud on your hands. Terpenes control scent/flavor in MJ & have nothing to do with the compounds that influence potency: cannabinoids & THC.  A related myth is X scent is superior to all others, I've seen this mostly in regards to diesels. I remember seeing a gorgeous looking, fat budded plant, with a nice amount of trichomes (crystals) that had the strongest diesel smell I ever encountered. Alas this plant was no good for anything but breeding stock as the strain had an incredibly weak high which would require breeding with a potent plant.  This particular myth started out due to the preponderance of strong scented indicas but then became a novelty marketing strategy & just part of the bag appeal in it's own right as evidenced by the profusion of strains offering exotic fragrances from chocolate, to cheese, to fruits, to fuel, to spice, to pine and then some.  This is not to say smell plays no part in the enjoyment of the smoking experience, but it really has no impact on the high itself.  3 - The more sticky crystals on the bud, the more potent the smoke.  At first blush this seems like it makes sense, as those crystals known as trichomes are the parts that contain the active ingredients of cannabinoids & THC but more crystals are no guarantee of anything but pretty crystals - there are many, many ""white"" strains of mediocre potency and below average highs that are just teaming with snow.  It is entirely cosmetic with no effect on potency. Lots of crystals are pure marketing, it sparkles, it's pretty but there are snowy white strains that pack no punch and plants with few crystals that are extremely potent.  4 - Its hard to know if the strain name is correct.  Unless you are purchasing from a grower, or someone who works directly with a grower, you really have no way of knowing whether what you are getting is really what the name says it is.  This isn't to say that you are being lied to by the seller: they most likely were told ""this is the real deal sour D""  or whatever the flavor of the month is.  They don't know they were lied to and there is absolutely no way for the average weed purchaser to know with any certainty the strain actually is what they've been told it is.  You may have tried ""Sour Diesel"" before and liked it, but when you get it again its totally different.  You have no way of knowing if the first smoke was Sour D, the second, or neither.  The business is generally dominated by people known as ""flippers"".  These are guys (well, mostly guys   who purchase pounds, ""five-packs"" or ""ten-packs"" of bud, and see a slight markup when they sell generally receiving one or two hundred $ profit on each pound they ""flip"" to either another flipper or to an end retailer aka a dealer.  Bud can pass through many hands this way before it finally reaches your dealer, and all it takes is one unscrupulous flipper somewhere in the chain to hide the true identity of the weed.  That being said, there are different versions of Sour Diesel out there, offered in different forms by different breeders.  Strains that come from different origins/breeders but bear the same name inevitably have differences.  This is why we provide the breeder name with our strain descriptions:  we want you to know exactly what you are getting.  We also use breeders that have created highly regarded, unique & in some cases either famous or award winning strains which we grow, increasing the chances of using superior bud genetics which also means our strain names are accurate and meaningful.   All this obviously leads to...  So how do I judge the quality of my weed?  Now that the common myths & their reasons for being has been disclosed, where does that leave the buyers? How can you tell if a strain is any good? Unfortunately my best recommendation if you don't want to grow yourself is find a knowledgable, honest seller that knows these things, and can provide descriptions of the effects of their plants other than merely ""dank"" ""A+++"" or ""med quality"". Experienced growers & sellers who have the high as their main priority will know what makes amazing, unique smoke worthy of your time & money and can speak intelligently about it. If they sound like they aren't very knowledgeable, they probably don't know or care about selling you a product that gives you the best high they can give. Your order will likely be hit or miss. Do not hesitate to ask a seller questions, if they don't respond or say something that indicates to you that this is a person just trying to turn a quick buck, move on. Let the vendor know what you're looking for, a heavy indica is a vastly different experience from a sativa haze. They can steer you to the right strain or another vendor that may have something more to your liking.   Here are the basics of what really determines the best buds  #1 Strain/Genetics selection  Our Bogglegum is definitely conventionally attractive bud but we'd have thrown it in the garbage if it gave an unpleasant, weak or merely average high with nothing special to recommend it. The truth is the prettiest most photogenic buds tend to be average smoke or worse with a few notable exceptions. We chose Bogglegum because amongst growers it was recommended as great smoke (Bogglegum won us the last Silk Road 420 competition for best Hybrid) and as a bonus it smells nice and looks pretty. We grew them out, then we chose the plant that had the nicest high. There is variation even in strains that breed true so growers select carefully from the plants they've grown out - you can select for the high, for yield, for scent & all sorts of things. We at Angel Eyes always go for what we agree is the best high. We've thrown out entire strains and with them the months of TLC that we put into growing them out because they had negative effects we don't want to sell to our customers.  #2 Proper Care & Handling from Seed to Harvest to Drying, Curing & Storage  I was skeptical that MJ would be greatly effected by how it's treated from growing to storage. As you can tell by our selling point: our curing process, use of organics, after harvest techniques to control the character of the high & careful handling after storage & shipping, I've learned that the effects & potency of MJ is determined largely by how it's treated, after harvest as much or more than during growing. It goes without saying that curing & allowing the bud to mature and change is not compatible with commercial growers/dealers interested in high volume as it takes time and attention. See for yourself if you find yourself with some so-so bud, put it in a mason jar (if it's too dry, add a bit of an orange peel for a day, if it's too wet, leave the jar open until it dries to your liking). Give it a 2 week cure by storing it in a dark cool place (a drawer will do fine) & open the jar every few days for 5-10 minutes just to air the bud as part of the cure. It'll turn your average bud into something a lot better than you had two weeks ago!   Well, that's the straight dope on what's hype and what's real when it comes to marijuana from our crew, friends & aficionados to anyone reading this. Hope that cleared the air some.  Sincerely, Ava",

This has been the two weeks from hell over here.  So an immediate family member died, and that was shitty enough.  Then we had the most annoying little fuck-twerp on Agora polluting our review thread with his screaming insanity about us being scammers, liars and that our weed suxx dude.  OMFG.  I've never had such an annoying mosquito buzzing around my head before, and he was impossible to kill until I finally figured out which customer he was (he used diff name on forums) and told him I was going to blacklist him.  He finally shut up, but not before showing his weed ignorance for the entire world to see, which was nice.  He complained that the buds were fluffy (stringy was the word he used) and I attempted to explain the difference between true sativas and things people call sativas but are not.  It was all in vain.  Then he thought he'd give his coup de grace by announcing he was smoking some beautiful Jack Herer, a sativa, and that he knew all about that shit.  So I had a laugh and informed him that Jack Herer is actually an almost perfectly balanced hybrid, slightly sativa dominant.  While a nice strain, its most assuredly not a true sativa.  Laughable man.  I bet he smoked a whole jay of Kali Mist and watched his brain melt in the mirror  .

I had posted a thread here on the CR forums about pain management for my father, and got a lot of advice.  One of the nice vendors to reply was Ava from AngelEyes.  After quick and thorough communication through the market, Ava was good enough to split up my order into both the UV and Non-UV Lebowski and I have to say the effects were dramatically different for me.  The ""Classic"" or traditional Non-UV dried gave me a very uplifting energetic feeling and allowed me to actually get things done around the house and do some work.  The high came on quickly and lasted for quite some time (about 2.5 hours with about 4 vape hits).   The UV dried Lebowski had me in a really nice mellow couch lock after 4 vape hits and I was ""feeling no pain"".  I specifically tried this at night, since indica leaning strains usually give me a nice couch lock.  And I was not disappointed, as the UV drying method definitely does bring out the indica nature of this strain.  After about 2 hours or so I started to come down and just wanted my bed!  A great cure for insomnia or any sleeping issues you may have.   tl;dr All in all, the Big Lebowski from AngelEyes is a great strain and depending on what effects you want you can choose between the two different drying methods.  I will definitely be ordering more of this!  Thank you again, Ava, for a very pleasant ordering experience, and answering all my questions quickly.",

I almost Misted the whole thing due to my own ineptitudeness. I had a mixed order of Kali and Lebowski and made the rookie mistake of loading them into identical jars, burnt the packing material, labels and all, and set about planning for that Kali Ride - I'd heard about this stuff for a long while but could never seem to sync up with the AE train and actually have some in my hand, until that very moment in time.   Of course, these buds actually look and smell quite similar, so when it became time to start, I was at a total loss for how best to proceed. Long story short, Eni-Meni-Mini-Mo-Ro-Sham-Bo-Got-To-Go-What-You-Say-On-My-Way, you guessed it, I picked the Lebowski. Well, delightful, as always, but the lovely Ava had described this as a very different kind of thing, so, ok, pretty good, if this was, in fact, the correct path to enlightenment. I haven't been puffing quite as much recently, so it was a little while until I got to try the other jar.   Crunched, rolled, smelled, admiring the AE handiwork, but still hard to tell if this bud was my Old Lebowski, or something very different. I mean, I was promised something like a one hit wonder, and this stuff looked quite wonderful, but still quite familiar. I was warned about going too fast with the Kali, so I made a plan for that. I paired the smoke with a Macanudo, just one hit of Kali, then enjoy my cigar and attempt to quantify my response.   I knew right away, that spicy taste was just way too familiar, but not from a recent memory, this wasn't BLUV, or any of the AE line I had tried to that point. This was like a vary old friend, I know I remembered that flavor, like a sweet curry, but could not tell from when it came. I rested for a while and wrote an essay about a video game. Then, I started planning for my next hit. Returning to the back yard, the rain had stopped, I fired back up the mild tobac, fully prepared to take that next hit. That little Portofino was truly the best match to the Kali and seems to have formed a perfect long term relationship.   Long story short, I forgot to take that second hit. I was looking through the fridge for another 21st Amendment Monkey Beer, and realized that I'd have to make another attempt at hit number two. That may well be the definition of a one hit wonder, so I smiled when I realized what had happened, then I wrote another essay.   Anyway, short story long, Ava had warned me that three really good hits could make you forget your name. I did make it to three, but I failed to produce a report on the lost name thing - I forgot to ask myself if I could remember my own name. Not a normal thing, to say to youself, self, can you recall what your name is? Since your mind assumes that you would know the answer, it can easily forget to ask, so not sure if the Kali will do that or not. Some further investigation may be required.   So, only Ava knows the whole truth, but I know she sure makes some good Ganja, so I did remember her name, and said well done sweet Ava, I think I've guessed your real name, it wasn't the one that I thought before. Later that same evening, I had to take three puffs of some Grape Lebowski just to slow things down to normal speed, I watched the most amazing Sade concert video while falling into a deep slumber. No one called my name, so even the Grape couldn't answer that question.   In the final analysis, the spiceness of the Kali Mist is quite special.  Thanks Ava,  -Duderino",

Some of the healthiest buds I've seen. You will never see buds like this coming from your local jackass weed grower. Smooth and soft in fingers, a white, velvety sheen comes off in fingers handling them. Easy to deconstruct. Smells fantastic, it is a strong, healthy herbal smell, not a weak and stale smell when you've ended up with poor quality weed and already regretting the transaction before you open it. There is a very high amount of THCs on the buds and the health and quality of the crop is very good. Whoever grew this knew what they were doing, it has grown healthy and been harvested quite well. Warnings:  No Side effects:  No Comedown:  No Time tested (redose from original batch after minimum 30 days):  Yes   02.20:  Light blunt. Lights like a dream.  02.20-2.30:  Heavy toking. Tastes woody,  feels woody, going down my throat. Tastes a little like the homemade cigar I made from bark when I was in my early teens. This is harsher than I expected, I didn't expect this level of woodiness. 02.37:  Slight pressure gathering to corneas. 02.41:  Strong aftertaste that has just gone after 3 mins on the end of a rather strong drag.  02.55:  Blunt is naturally getting stronger towards the tail end, leaving a strong bark taste in on my tongue. The smoke from the blunt smells entirely of bark, with zero cannabis aroma. This particular cannabis bud is extremely aromatic, but has been circumvented by the bark. This type of blunt is designed to conceal the smell of cannabis, and be smoked in public. Having smoked the majority of the blunt without a hint of cannabis smell, I can say it has not failed in this respect. 02.56:  Pupils slightly dilated. Not anwhere near coke levels, but there neonetheless.   03.02:  Finished rest of the blunt, which had to be re-lit first as it had gone out. 03.12:  Slight bit of couch-lock setting in. Well, I suspected this was going to be an indica session about 20 minutes ago when I noticed I hadn't been much affected yet. I'm annoyed. 03.15:  I'm annoyed. 03.18:  I'm still anoyed, so I am going to light a cone and see if that takes me anywhere. 03.22:  Grind up another .40 grams, which will be stronger with the shorter canvas,  and mix with light tobacco so I can really smell and taste the cannabis this time. 03.41:  After very carefully and densely packing an overfull cone, light it. 03.41-56:  Furious toking.   03.43:  This is a lot more aromatic. The weed aroma is very noticeable, and it tastes a lot more pleasant. This cone is stronger than the typical cone for some reason, the taste is a little more like bark. 03.54:  Ears just unblocked. Body load is fast leaving. Vision a tad different, and I have a light-headed moment when I stood up just then. It's pretty clear from only this early in that this might be turning sativa. 03.56:  Confidence levels are raising. Talking louder, and a little more spontaneous. Slight pressure in head building. Mood lifting. 04.01:  Balance affected. Typing affected. Slight static in ears when music is paused. 04.09:  A voice sounds a little polyphonic, like it is tunnelling from one area of the room.  04.10:  Tobbaco taste is getting overpowering, and is overwhelming any aromatic taste the cannabis brought earlier in the smoke. Starting to taste like a cheap cigarette now. 04.13:  Young Smokey has breathed his last breath, and is buried with a ceremony. 04.15:  Cone ended, I toke on my eshisha, but it just doesn't compare and I soon put it away. 04.22:  Very low level of stone in my eyes. 04.31:  Slight foregrounds-to-backgrounds warping. Balance is being affected and I start drifting slightly. ~04.41:  Effects of slight foregrounds-to-backgrounds warping have all but disappeared. 04.50:  Starting to regain balance, eyes returing to normal. 04.59-05.14:  Television foregrounds are standing out further. They didn't on my indica segment earlier, though. ~05.16-06.04:  Return to baseline, though the lights on my laptop are suddenly a lot lighter, and fuzzier. Eyes heavy from tiredness.  06.05:  Lights on laptop returned to normal, and they're no longer occluding my vision like blurry little balls of phospherous. Television has returned to normal, I'm falling alseep, and I'm done with the session.   Comments:  This session was off of a blunt and a cone. A very bad tasting blunt that furnished an indica experience, and a rather enjoyable cone that provided a sativa experience. I'm no closer to finding out what causes the onset of either in a hybrid, but it seems very common for one cone to produce the opposite effect of the next in the same session. This indica cocoon was not as dense as the previous session, nor were the sativa effects as pronounced this time round. Overall, yet another good session.",

The soaring high is inspirational in higher doses, and at low doses the head is clear and ready for action while the body feels strong and relaxed at the same time.  The comedown is almost non-existent with none of the discomfort or sullenness of inferior strains.  Kali Mist won the Cannabis Cup twice and placed once: 1995 - 1st place ""Hydro Cup"", 2000 - 1st place ""Sativa Cup"" & 2002 - 3rd place ""Sativa Cup"". In our opinion the awards are well-earned.  **********************",

Just finished smoking a nice big joint of some Grape Bogglegum, and wow.  First of all Angel Eyes has some great stealth, could not have been happier when I saw how much work went into it. Always good to see a vendor who makes safety a priority   Several visual barriers accompanied by an MBB+vac seal.  Once I reached the last layer it was neatly labeled with the strain name/weight. After slicing that open and wafting the bag I noticed a strong smell of, you guessed it, grapes! This strain truly reeks of a deep citrus/grape and is extremely intense, I personally could not get enough of it.  The buds were exactly as pictured and as I was weighing it out I could not help but notice the trichomes shimmering in the light. My 1/8 weighed out to about 3.75g! Lovely. I began pulling it apart and soon realized how little stems there were, nice fluffy buds, had to wash my fingers off before I rolled my joint due to the stickiness.  Nice, slow, even burn, tastes wonderful and the high couldn't be better. Wasn't sure if this was sativa or indica dominant and could not discern any noticeable effects that would tell me. So I am just going to chalk the GB as a very potent hybrid. I'm sure Angel Eyes can educate us further    All in all I could not be happier with my first transaction with Angel Eyes and I cannot wait to try a few more of her strains.  Thanks!!",

One point I'd like to clarify about the UV'd ChemdawgXG13 that might not be clear from our strain description and other things I've written about it.  The pheno of ChemXG13 we grow is a very dominant sativa example of what should be a hybrid/balanced strain.  UV brings out MORE of the small indica side of the strain (G13), but I'd still call the UV'd buds sativa dominant.  That said, and as your trip reports describe very well, so much depends on timing and personal mood such that even a strong sativa strain, if imbibed when one is tired, may behave very differently from when one is wide awake and alert.  And those are only two of the most obvious states that can change the experience of a strain.  As  you know, marijuana is a psychedelic drug (esp. high THC varieties like the ChemXG13), more similar to mushrooms or LSD than any other drugs.  And as anyone who has experimented with heavier psychedelics to any extent knows state of mind, place and general physiological shape factor heavily into the experience one will have and your trip reports really bring that out.  Anyhow, thanks again Whiteball.  FYI, we are going to be growing a bunch of new strains over the next 6 months and I'd love you to take a stab at reporting on any that peak your interest.  I'd be happy to provide you some free product towards that goal  .   I'll be describing the strains we'll be growing over the coming weeks and I'm planning to take some polls to see if people have a greater interest in some over others so we can decide which to grow out first.

Some of the healthiest buds I've seen. You will never see buds like this coming from your local jackass weed grower. Smooth and soft in fingers, a white, velvety sheen comes off in fingers handling them. Easy to deconstruct. Smells fantastic, it is a strong, healthy herbal smell, not a weak and stale smell when you've ended up with poor quality weed and already regretting the transaction before you open it. There is a very high amount of THCs on the buds and the health and quality of the crop is very good. Whoever grew this knew what they were doing, it has grown healthy and been harvested quite well. Warnings:  No Side effects:  No Comedown:  No Time tested (redose from original batch after minimum 30 days):  Yes   06.43:  Light cone. I'm not feeling the best so I'm only lighting up 1 tonight. Besides, going out tomorrow, so I'll do a proper session then. This is a better cone than the one I rolled earlier this week. For one thing, it is made with premium paper, almost possessing a cardboard-like consistency, and the stronger fibers hold the contents without crinkling the base. For another, it's one of the better ones I've made. I've squashed this really tight and with a lot of care, so it will be a denser smoke. 06.51:  Slight bellring has started in my ears.  05.55:  Getting a little heady, palms beginning to sweat.  06.57-07.04:  Feeling a bit withdrawn. 07.05:  Coming out of it, and confidence is back again. Warmth in head leaving a bit. 07.40:  Slight body load. 07.45:  Light second cone.  07.47-08.30:  Enter the smog. Starting to relax, but there's no altering visual aspect that sativa brings. Buildings look the same, clouds look the same, and if this were night I do not think I would detect any difference in light. Couch-lock setting in. My walking is a lot more relaxed as well, despite the extra bodyload slowly accumulating. It is not a sudden, uncomfortable bodyload  caused by rapid weakness, as in the case of my whiteout, or when it felt I was merging into the fabric of materials, as in the case of my LSD trip. It is comfortable, moderate, and strangely numbing on my pain receptors, giving an overall sense of relaxation and calmness. I wouldn't call it bliss, but if I had pain, I suspect it would have been numbed over. This happened with my last indica experience off of the current X when I stubbed my toe and pain shut off promptly after 2 s.  My voice pitch is changing and is throwing out louder. For some reason my voice took on a different accent at this stage. I didn't notice it at the time but I was informed after I got back home.  08.30:  Still feeling a bit heady. I'm starting to get a little tired. Indica may not be as trippy as sativa, but it has its purposes. I prefer sativa as indica typically just gives me a headache if the quality is not there. Besides, I like a good show. The quality for this indica, however,  is there. My visual cues interpretation is unaltered, I'm clear headed, but feel like I'm walking around wrapped in a light blanket. The pavement feels different somehow.  I barely feel it under my soles, like I'm suddenly wearing Nike Airs. And I'm referring to the  genuine Nike Airs, not what is being sold as Nike Air today where you still feel the ground under the sole and it costs less than $300 for a pair. 08.45-10.10:  Feel insulated and warm. In fact, I feel insulated in other ways too, as I've described above. It's a solid wrapping that does not fluctuate, but remains constant.  Eyes are starting to get heavy, both in terms of the pressure on my corneas, and struggling to stay awake.  ~09.10:  I'm having a bit of difficulty climbing the incline. My breathing is starting to get a little heavier and my leg muscles are aching a little. ~09.16-09.40:  My heightened confidence is starting to become a little dangerous. Dangerous for the wrong type to be around me and dangerous for me in terms of implications. I leave the place quickly and without suspicion.  10.14: Effects are already wearing off to some degree. I'm right where I should be under the influence of indica. Spread out on a big pile of pillows, chilled music permeating out from the speakers, a drink in hand, and some rather disconnected and meaningless television lulling me into a deep sleep.  Comments:  As above, this was an indica session from a Chemdawg X G13 that doesn't seem to want to go. It took me by surprise because in most sessions, it has provided a sativa experience, so the effects for this slipped under my radar and into my system for about 30 minutes before I realised I was looking for the wrong thing. This was a nice little bubble for me for a few hours. That's the only way I can describe it. Not strong enough to be defined as bliss, not even strong enough to be labelled a cocoon, it was moreover a full-clarity  bubble where I was chilled like a wine in a wine cooler and nothing was capable of upsetting the flow around me. I have mentioned this ad nausem, but this really is a good bit of green. I have never had a bad session on it. I'm curious to know what exactly turns a sativa into an indica. I've heard it is possible to induce it though, if the right conditions are met.   I think I've debated this enough for all to read in my previous trip reports, so I will leave out the more technical talk. Suffice it to say, it is so far been reliable and provided me with some good mull-out sess's. The quality of bud can make the difference between a really good night, or a session that brings on a bad mood and a restless night's sleep. I'm nearly due for some more weed, and I'm looking forward to conducting more field testing with some different strains in the near future.",

There is a very high amount of THCs on the buds and the health and quality of the crop is very good. Whoever grew this knew what they were doing, it has grown healthy and been harvested quite well.    3.35  Lit cone. Smooth intake, tastes pleasant. 3.37  Little lightheaded already. Gee that was quick. Feel like being annoying for a change, a regular joe from Family Guy. 3.40  Semi stoned feeling of the indica type, as I suspected it might be. Eyes a little heavier, and vision a fraction occluded but not to the degree a coke cocoon will do, there was no slippage of time. 3.45  Slight tingling back cortex region. Subtle and shallow bellrings. Feint though.  3.54  Increase of warmth upper buddy from torso.  4.06  More indica chilled than sativa high, this mix has more of relaxed effect. Warmth fading a little. I needed to increase my fluids intake after this cone. Impressed with the effictiveness of these buds, it only took 55mg to produce a slight stupefying effect. Because I had given maryjane a rest, the effects were undoubtably more pronounced, but it is still very good green with a heavy concentrate of THC pollens.  4.45  Hunger increased slightly. No munchies yet. More relaxed about myself trying a new blend. A little apprehension beforehand may have killed some of the indica mood, overanalysed the ratio trying to figure out if the effects were going to come from the Chemdawg or G13. In the end it was slightly more indica, so my guess is G13. At any rate my mood's been fairly happy and cool with life so far, some strains just worsen my mood and give me a headache for a few minutes. 5.00  Redose. Just kidding, I lit up another .55g conical for Yours Truly. 5.10  My typing has certainly degraded in this report. Slightly harder of hearing at times and voice at times coming out louder.  5.20  Weak, shallow bellrings. More vigour detected though. Some numbness to pain. 5.25  Little bit stone-eyed.  5.28  Bellrings nearly faded. Slight peak of energy and more sharpness this time round, ears unblocked, sharper vision, more control over body and keyboard movement - not really indica qualities, no? I didn't expect this, but the second cone seemed to effect more of a sativa experience. Dulled pain in such a small quantity. 5.40  End of effects.   Comments: This particular weed has been well cared for. It is evidently from a very good quality harvest, cured well, and trimmed perfectly. The buds I received are teeming with THC. They look like they have been dusted with icing sugar, and minutely sparkled off the light, extremely dense. Odd to find sativa traits replace indica traits, very different experience second time round. This was a pleasure to smoke. It tastes strongly herbal and smells fragrant, a departure from the stale and nausious taste from cheaper sources. The buds themselves are potent as hell. One of the hybrids, probably the G13, could possibly be used to treat pain as the numbing effect was definitely there. Overall this is strong crop, I find it predominantly indica but still capable of giving sativa effects. Good for chilling, del Mar, and rounding off a day as a narcotic nightcap. This is quality weed, only a small quantity is needed due the high THC count so you can get away with a 50/50 MJ/T blend, if you want stronger then just 75/25 it as it's not your everyday weak weed. While it didn't make me overly tired when on it and moving around, this made me go out like a light as soon as I hit the pillow, giving really vivid dreams without a single interruption all night. When I was woken up, went back to sleep in seconds continuing the same vivid dream as before. Best sleep I have had in years. I would recommend the strain - and this harvest in particular as it's quite a good one - based on this quality for the treatment of insomnia, as well as the numbing effect it can provide for the relief of minor to moderate pain.

Honestly, still cannot tell them apart by smell or visual inspection, but I have them properly labelled by now, 'cause once you light that Kali, the spice is nice, and the quicker is licker, so it really is the flavor of the smoke that gives it away, most decidedly. I know I know that taste from somewhere, a dream perhaps, or from a long time ago, maybe straight from the land of a 1000 knights.     However, I think I've figured it all out. If the Kali is 1 1/2, then the Grape must be a 1.1, the LebowskiUV is a 1.22, and, based on my memory alone, cause I'm out of stock right now, the ChemDawg13 is 1 3/8 +/- 0.011.

I also wanted to update everyone on order status.  We shipped a bunch of orders Tuesday and should be able to get the rest out by Thursday.  I had a partner helping me package for a couple weeks but he's been called away by other work so its only me now, which is why I removed the 3-day guaranteed shipping policy from our vendor page.  If anyone has any questions please let me know.  -Ava",

I've stopped posting on it and from now on will post them here, and on my main trip report thread. nuiGood to see it up and well! Give us a review on the Bogglegum if you get round to writing while stoned on it.   @ AngelEyes: Hey, good to see you well!   You keep coming up in conversations when I'm comparing weed vendors. The Chemdawg X I got from you is the best I've had, just seems to suit me. Never had a bad session off of it. Came really well trimmed as well, I cannot recommend it enough. I realise strains are a personal choice and everyone is different, but it certainly is the strain for me. And you're right, mood, tiredness, and time of day can affect how a X will behave. Best solution: STONE OFTEN! and record the experience. The more you do it the more you learn.  @ Lupojak:  Cheers mate.   Lol! Bad wolfie, no more shrink advice for you. Remember, don't eat the hand that feeds you!     But what's my sack AE is making bulgier?     Yeah, I timestamp my entries as I write them. When I get too fucked up (like I did on LSD) my tripsitter starts taking over and writes as I dictate. It's better if it's accurate.   Cheers wolfie!   @ AngelEyes: I hardly ever go to a/g/o/r/a forums, just Silk Road 2 and of course here when I can, so thank you for informing me of the response. Thanks for the kind words Ava.   I'm clocking up a lot of experience from the Chemdawg X, I myself am surprised by it.   Thanks for clarifying about the sativa dominance in the UV cured version, it explains a hell of a lot, it all makes sense now. One thing though, yes, sativa is very much a psychedelic experience, like the trip vision I had 2 nights ago when I smoked Northern Lights and the room seemed to be a tunnel, and magic mushrooms probably even more so, but LSD doesn't just change your vision, it changes you vision  constancy, which is a whole new ball game. When trip vision goes, the illusion remains. An explanation can't do it justice, it is something you must try.      True, true, true. LSD in particular.   Thanks for the offer AE. May take you up on it!   There are some strains I'd love to field test, Northern Lights in particular. I believe I have some of your Big Lebowski coming my way, expect a report from me on that next month. Both myself and my tripsitter are eager to try from your listings when they come out.   @ TheOneTrueToker:  Hey bud, nice trip report!! So now you know about the sticky finger! It's all the trichomes on it. Careful with neighbours/parents, AE's green is aromatic as hell!     Look forward to hearing any more reports in the future you might make.  Keep up the good work AngelEyes.  Happy toking.","And as anyone who has experimented with heavier psychedelics to any extent knows state of mind, place and general physiological shape factor heavily into the experience one will have and your trip reports really bring that out."

Regarding sativas, I've decided its worth it to take a few ounces of the Kali Mist out of cure a couple days early so that we can get it out to people in time for July 4th, which is next Friday.  I'm putting up some Kali listings right now in 1/8 and 1/4 listings so anyone who wants a super party strain for the 4th can grab it.  I'm usually a stickler for the 2 week minimum cure but a couple days shouldn't make much difference if I'm to be honest.  So the Kali is up now for anyone who wants some for the 4th, come and get it!  I'd also recommend for July 4th festivities the Silver Haze.  The seeded variety we have on offer right now has a 5-6 week cure on it and its amazing.  Also, the Silver Haze buds we have left don't have very many seeds in them so you'd be getting almost all bud.

Some of the healthiest buds I've seen. You will never see buds like this coming from your local jackass weed grower. Smooth and soft in fingers, a white, velvety sheen comes off in fingers handling them. Easy to deconstruct. Smells fantastic, it is a strong, healthy herbal smell, not a weak and stale smell when you've ended up with poor quality weed and already regretting the transaction before you open it. There is a very high amount of THCs on the buds and the health and quality of the crop is very good. Whoever grew this knew what they were doing, it has grown healthy and been harvested quite well. Warnings:  No Side effects:  No Comedown:  No Time tested (redose from original batch after minimum 30 days):  Yes    00.30:  I light the cone and inhale deeply. Burns well. Tastes nice and mildly aromatic, possibly due to the good tobacco blend as well. Some aroma lost between now and last session, but it has kept fairly well. In addition, there is a more biased tobacco/cannabis ratio so of course it's going to be dominated by tobacco taste. MMmm, tobacco taste... 00:36:  My cone's gone out. The lighter has extinguished while I've been writing this, and we can't find another one. Looking around house for some source of flammage. MMmm, flammage... 00.39:  We can't find anything, so we light it again from the stove top. 00.41:  Relaxing a bit. 00.46:  Little bit of heat creeping up around my cranium. Lasts 10 minutes. Slight pressure on my corneas. 00.54:  Balance affected a little. Mood improved by ~40%. I am not calling this a euphoria, but it is close. I'm definately a lot happier and am dancing around a lot to the music. 00.56:  Whatever slight effects I had are leaving. My brain is cooling back down. What passed as a slight cocoon has receded to nothing. The ever so slight perimeter darkness has disintigrated. 01.17:  Lights look different. So do buildings. So does my vision. My vision looks like it is bopping up and down a fraction, like I'm jogging on clouds. It looks like I am walking a lot faster than I am. Buildings look more solid, solids appear much clearer. I'm stunned. I had no idea that cannabis in low doses could do this. Why am I only finding this out now? No one I have known have EVER compared cannabis to coke on a low dose. Colours are not clearer, but everything else is, and my vision streetches a lot further, seeking out every nook and cranny with the brightened vision lighting up the night so slightly, yet so effectively. It's almost like animal vision, hard to describe exactly. My vision is thrown out further, while objects up close get little scrutiny. The lights themselves seem to throw out more light, and they are buzzing with a blurry halo around them. This is different to MDMA in the way that MDMA will make the actual light seem bigger, brighter, and clear. This is not so clear: the lights are indistinct balls of fuzzy glowing energy, but there is defintely more light on the street. Additionally, there is a slight, mild yellowness that is emitted in a gentle, translucent sheen  in the air. 01.21:  Sensing bad energy from a side street. I've walked past countless times but have never detected this prior. It's not a human energy, it is more of a historically bad energy. I cannot describe it any other way, however this statement will make sense to L-25 users. 01.25:  Trees look warped against the sky backdrop as I walk by. They don't look 3D but there is definitely something weird going on, like they are much more separated from their background. Looks like I am driving past them quickly. 01.27:  My breathing gets a tad heavier. A bit of ego death. Either this or I sense something approaching. Human, from the sense of things. Some kind of self-proclaimed ""hero"" is up ahead, and I feel the negative energy from them. 01.29:  Our self-proclaimed ""hero"" makes an appearance as we round the corner. Turns out to be a moronic drunk who's been bested by alcohol tonight. He comes with a matching friend, equally drunk and equally a ""hero"". They stop shouting when they see us and start talking more quietly. 01.34: Ego death has died off, my breathing returns to normal, and with it a return to my regular voice depth and volume. 01.36:  A slight awareness of my chest. It is not hurting, but I feel the air rasp out of my chest, and then it's gone again. 01.44:  Colours around lights are very pronounced, and throw themselves out around the light source vividly. Longsight vision very good. 01.49:  Hearing has strangely improved.  03.55:  Light up another cone, but the tip for some reason becomes wet, it is unable to be fully lit, and it keeps extinguishing. I can only obtain a few inhales before it dies completely. 04.25:  Light up a third cone. It holds. Tastes of strong tobacco and herbal undertones of weed. 04.25-04.35: 10 minutes of furious dragging. The effects of this cone will probably hit me harder. I have a hard time keeping it alight. I had the same problem last session, only the green was absorbed through the paper even more with a higher MJ/T ratio. It appears that the high THC count may have something to do with it, as lower quality weed seems to be a lot drier and be self contained a lot more effectively. After storing this cannabis for about 2 months, I expected it to be drier. I have not cured it, but I thought it would dry at least dry to a small increment. A blunt may be more effective for the next session. Failing that, a pipe. 04.43:  The keyboard push buttons are just perciptibly starting to turn green. Curious. There is no green lighting present. I am looking at them at differing angles, but they are still green, not black. 04.46:  Slight vision distortion again, this time it's the bench. Every time I take a step closer to it, it is starting to ripple fast. I step back and it stops.  04.51: Munchies are setting in. 04.58: Colours are slightly more vivid. Not to the degree as they are on MDA, but there nonetheless. If I hadn't been paying attention, I wouldn't have noticed this, or chalked it up my eyes playing tricks. 04.59: Music sounds a little clearer, but not in the same way that MDMA or LSD does. It sounds better, part of the spectrum is  clearer and punchier, but in a slightly different way than I'm used to. 05.16-05.29: Music significantly improved, even if not imroved on the clarity scale by that much. It sounds like music sounded like when I was about 21. Or when a stereo is brand new and you are listening to tracks on the system for the first time. 05.30-05.39: I'm not getting as much effect from this second cone even though I had more drags from it. Maybe my high was affected by my tripsetter's bad mood while I was stuffing my conical. Or maybe it's because it is now daytime, and I can't pick up the same lighting effects as before. 05.44:  The buildings are starting to look warped again, and have sharper outlines. But this is a mere fraction of what it was before, and I soon tire of looking sideways. I'm having the same issue of feeling like I'm walking faster than I am. The bopping is gone this time round. 05.48-05.58:  Clouds are again warped in this weird 2D 1/2 visual aspect that is remarkably different from the embossing and 3D found in L-25. How can I explain this? They're 3D but they're not, they're 2D but they're not, they appear somehow in between these two dimensions. They billow like sheets on a line, rather than staying flat in the sky. For the second time, tall trees look removed from their backgrounds and they are standing out weirdly, appearing much closer than they really are. Colours are still sharp, especially green, which constantly blob around in my vision, sometimes making it appear that I'm in a forest. Or South West England, where the trees all smoke pot judging by the appearance of them. (They're green, very green. The earth red, very red. Great for psychedelic sessions when colours are starting to heighten.) 05.54-05.58:  Visual flickering. Objects take the aspect of other objects. Very slight schizophrenic-like confusion of visual cues. 06.12: Returning to normality. Effects have faded, I'm looking online for blunts, I'm hungry because I have the munchies for the second time tonight, and I feel like chilling in front of the television until I fall asleep.  Comments:  This was a revisit session to determine if the product had altered in any way in regards to quality. This is more applicable to cocaine where a mix cut may have been added, and the short-term effects garnered by this have diminished over time to reveal the real purity of a batch. This session was done off a superior harvest of some very good green. The strain was a hybrid, the Chemdawg X G13 which was supposed to be predominantly indica through the UV curing. I found it isn't always indica, in fact I've had more of a sativa experience with this bud. Only one cone out of several has been furnished an indica experience, and my body load was not very heavy anyway. This session was quite psychoactive. I'm glad I finally got back to smoking weed because I was starting to fear it. I didn't quite know what to expect after last time, but when nothing happened I relaxed and started to enjoy the inhales deeply and with more appreciation.   I probably will be revisting this particular UV cured strain in the future as I've found it quite enjoyable in every cone I've lit with it. ",

It is helpless anger, for his anger will change nothing.  Sometimes, it is hard to live with these two wolves inside me, for both try to dominate my spirit  The boy looked intently into his grandfathers eyes, and asked, Which one wins?  The old man smiled, and quietly said, The one I feed.",

The intention, at least originally, was rather to make certain people opened the link manually through TOR, and not through their clearnet browser.  Theoretically, going to clearnet links that you saw on the darknet is a way to easily get deanonymized.  If I were in law enforcement, for example, I may post a link to a law-enforcement controlled clearnet server on a vendor's discussion forum. Something like  www.fakedruginformationdomainname.com/stuff. The law enforcement could then look at all the people who accessed that very specific LEO-controlled domain and correctly ascertain that ALL of them were vendors or darknet-related IP addresses.  So to summarize: Never ever open any clearnet links you find on the darknet on your clearnet browser, KEEP IT IN TOR, where you are (at least we hope) mostly safe. ",

If you aren't a bong snob like me you wouldn't notice but i clean it daily and its pretty easy. When its clean there is not a better smoke when the coil is frozen.   2.

Mitchell was originally pulled over for not having a seat belt, citing that, at 450 pounds, he was too large to put one on. The deputy who pulled Mitchell and Keithian Roberts over saw that both men were acting nervously, and soon brought a K-9 unit to the scene. In addition to the marijuana, police found cocaine, $7,000 and a gun, according to WFTV.  Mitchell was charged with drug possession (marijuana) in addition to the seat belt violation, while Roberts was charged with drug possession (cocaine).

Now to the bud: The taste is extremely reminiscent of freshly cut grass or leaves, with a hint of mint and citrus. This seems like some really special weed, Im pretty up there. KingCheese describes their weed as top grade dispensary quality, and I'm inclined to believe them based on what I have here.   As for the specific mental effects (whats normally of interest when dealing with Sativas), the high is very uplifting, its very good at limiting the negative thought spirals that Im used to with depression. I don't feel like being all that active (though I don't normally), but it seems very good for creativity.  Here's the strain on leafly: ***Clearnet Warning***  http://www.leafly.com/sativa/lamb-s-bread  ***Clearnet Warning***   It seems to match up to what's described, so totally worth a try if you're looking for some premier weed.

Domopost in it for the score! I don't know about you scammers out there, but I believe in a vendor account that has 1k transactions and all the packages have arrived with no seizures.   Sure there will be scam artists out there that will try their leg for free stuff at vendors as well. Although, we will do our best to satisfy the clients that just wants a hassle free , reliable, and fast ordering experience from us.  Such example is that we offer extra weight and shipping priority (on the same day) when the client has FE for us (orders 28G or higher). This is Domopost's way of saying thanks since our shipping days are on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.   So my advice for customers is to see if your vendor offers any kind of bonus for FEing for them. If not you are better off using Cannabis Road's escrow system.  Although one might point out that our sample package (4G) has to be FE to be approved and unfortunately for us being a new vendor it sounds shady as hell. This is why the package is priced very aggressively including free shipping in only three countries: the UK, Canada and USA. This is done so that Domopost can maintain top tier customer service.  FEing allows us to keep the costs low, passing on the savings to the client. Due to the small amount being sent, the rate of success is extremely high, therefore having tracking on this product is redundant and adds unnecessary costs to our customers.   We can only try our best to fight the stigma, as our score and relations with customers is more rewarding than ripping people off.   Domo",

I almost decided to give up on this market at first. However, I think this could be an opportunity to help build community here on Cannabis Road if some generous honest vendor(s) offered to send out goodwill feel-better gifts-in-kind to those who got ripped off by this scammer  a bit like the raffle that's running here on the forum.  If any proud vendors want to stand up and reaffirm the integrity of this market's community, then please reply here or reach out to support and hopefully they can put you in touch with the victims of this scam. I can promise you that this act of strength and compassion will make for a lasting impression on first-time buyers who just got burned.

He setup under the name WestCoastCollective, had no reputation from any other markets, and was apparently asking all his customers to FE. We thought this was pretty fishy, so we suspended his account, chatted with him a bit, and he basically fessed up to being a scammer.   We're sorry to anyone who lost money to this guy     We want to take this moment to remind you guys to *please please please* not FE, ESPECIALLY when you have no reason to trust the seller.  WestCoastCollective has been banned now and we have introduced our vendor bond to hopefully cut down on this being a possibility in the future.   Escrow is a powerful tool and any respectable vendor will allow you to use it. If there's a vendor requesting ""FE only"" you should seriously consider and think:  ""Why does he need FE when many other very respectable sellers do not?"". The answer is that it's usually always a scam.   Be careful out there and we'll do our best to proactively catch these scumbags before they can do too much damage. Furthermore, encourage your vendors to use multisig! It really isn't hard and we have super easy to follow step-by-step guides on the forums. Multisig would make all scams impossible!

Lacking a visa credit card, the other quick option is virwox. You can buy SSL (SLL?) with real money, and buy bitcoins with that. However I've found the fees often approach 10% by the time you have your coins out of their site. Took me a few transactions that I undershot by like five dollars until I figured out to spend about 15% more than I'd need for the listing    There are other ways to buy btc of course, but these two have served me pretty well, despite annoying fees and btc fluctuations.

I wonder if others are experiencing the same?  Comparing vendors isn't relevant here (although ML is awesome!). I play those games in my head too, basing expectations on past experience. With different people, circumstances, productsoon I realize the flaw in the logic.   Also, response time can be affected by a lot of factors, tracking numbers can be mixed up, errors increase with increased pressure. For a vendor with an acceptable history and wide exposure  - unlikely to suddenly turn scammy - a wait and see approach usually works, for the short term at least. That is a difficult mindset when you can see the bottom of the stash jar.  Been there...and there are few greater frustrations than when you can see the vendor logging in daily, apparently ignoring your messages, while you stare at an empty mailbox.  If I were a high volume vendor, who hit some kinda snag, I would appreciate an opportunity to get a mass message to my customers to take some heat off. You know, be pro-active.  When a vendor who is lagging on orders for whatever reason,  perhaps they could be encouraged to take a few minutes to post a brief announcement in these forums, and reference it on their profile page. This would help control expectations, head off these posts of concern, and reduce on site messages of ""dude, wheres my weed?!?"", which also increase lag.   This will free up the vendor to catch up on orders, without having to do individual damage control. If the explanation is satisfactory, and deliveries start showing up, it might cut down on support tickets as well.  ",

If it is more efficient, I see some like Swazi kief at $5-10/g. Seems like at least it will not have so much chlorophyll. I'm thinking to just buy some shatter to try it out before attempting making QWISO.I'm not Pyro, but I have done a simple test extraction with 1-2 grams of low grade kief.  I used the totally unorthodox method of using denatured alcohol (ethanol, methanol, 2 different other denaturing agents).  I will say that the extraction does work but it is hard to get it clean.  Even with multiple coffee filtering tries it always seemed to have particulate matter.  The extraction using denatured alcohol worked very well otherwise.  The consistency turned out just as a very dark shatter or just below.  I can say it tastes just like I'd expect though since I did use very low grade kief.  If you use this method I HIGHLY advise you to check the MSDS for your specific denatured alcohol product.  Some have more 'baddies' than others.  The one I have is relatively bad but this was just an experiment and I've only tasted a very small amount - the rest will be tossed.  If you look deep enough you'll find a very long thread on the internet detailing years worth of one (or a few) guy's experiments.I'm no chemist, so I'll likely be not doing the denatured extraction again unless I can find a product that has easily extractable baddies.  I believe plain ketones are easy enough to remove.  Once you get into the higher temperature boiling point compounds (Hexane, Heptane, who knows what else) then it seems like it becomes counter productive since you may actually be harming the THC."

For a concentrate extraction, any plant matter that ends up in the final product will degrade it, therefore plant parts with less THC & CBD are less desirable from that standpoint.   Sugar, butter, and cocoa powder can hide a lot of sins, so with a butter extraction for edibles, there is a lot wider margin for error than say, making shatter for vaping.

With regard to yield numbers, I do my math a bit differently. Only use quality product so thc is gonna be there, but difficult to determine precisely.      Just going from experience, with just shake, trim, leaf parts, yield is around 10%; a good nug run can get up to 35%, depending on strain. So just in general, assuming everything else being equal, your estimate of 20% is actually a pretty good average - a frosty trim (mixed shake/bud) extraction, of say 5 grams, would yield about 1g of oil. More or less.  Over here, there is no fudge factor, with negligable loss.  Having the right tools for the job helps.  Practice makes perfect!  Happy to go over details whenever...     ","Pyro,What's your typical yield?I ask yield because I've already burned thru my 1st gram and I'm gonna attempt my own batch.I assume yield is dependent upon THC % and 'fudge factor'?Let me know if I'm thinking right?!  I'm using round numbers to make the calculations easier.Start with 28g of weed (bud, not trim) with about 20% THC.  In a perfect world and 100% extraction I'd get 28 x 20% = 5g extract.  Assume I have 70% efficiency extracting.  30% plant matter or just left behind.  5g x 70% = 3.5g extract.So for every ounce of weed I can get an 1/8 oz of concentrate?Trim would go lower because of THC % would be lower.Am I thinking along the right track?Also,When using ISO, is a purge necessary or is that just a step to shorten time?  In my experience in non-weed playing around, ISO evaporates completely without residue."

A fan blow over, not on the iso/oil, is what you want. IMO the box/shower curtain thing is not gonna do what you want it to.  I do 3-4 washes, started with 5grams the last time..maybe that was the confusion. BEen using a glass microwave platter to evap on..working pretty well. Tried a silpat but didnt work out. BIG MESS!!  The fumes go away pretty quickly, best to do it in open area, cheese cloth or screen is ok if the room is super dusty or dog hair ridden like my place...but usually the fan will keep any dust from settling on oil.

I have seen people point a fan into a box to bounce the air over and back. I am thinking pyrex dish covered with cheesecloth on a little table in a cut out box. Box fan blows over this so most air bounces over and back out a window, cover the whole thing with a shower curtain or plastic liner and seal with tape to keep the gases away from the indoor space for the most part.I saw that larger surface areas purge faster, but are more of a pain to scrape. What size dish are you using? I was thinking like a 5x9 pyrex or similar.I have seen a lot of people do only 2-3 washes, but you are doing 5. How long is each taking you?

I used Home Depot, but I know this brand is also available at Lowes and at least Wal-Mart.  I paid roughly $16 a gallon. The brand is Klean Strip in a red/blue metal gallon container. According to the MSDS sheet it contains:  3. Composition/Information on IngredientsHazardous Components (Chemical Name)Ethyl alcohol {Ethanol} 64-17-5CAS #40.0 -50.0 %Concentration1.Methanol {Methyl alcohol; Carbinol; Woodalcohol}2. 67-56-1 50.0 -55.0 %Methyl isobutyl ketone {Hexone;Isopropylacetone; MIBK;4-Methyl-2-pentanone}3. 108-10-1 1.0 -4.0 %4. Acetic acid, ethyl ester {Ethyl acetate} 141-78-6 0.5 -1.5 %5. Heptane 142-82-5 0.5 -1.5 %I'm listing boiling points for these.  If you have access to vacuum then this could be considerably lower. I'm no chemist at all, but from my reading -  we have no issues with Ethanol and Methanol.  These all boil at fairly low temperatures. 78.37 °C (173.07 °F for ethanol), 64.7 °C (148.5 °F for methanol) Methyl isobutyl ketone - relatively low boiling point. 117 to 118 °C (243 to 244 °F).  Plenty of studies on rats and human subjects out there.  Personally I don't want to inhale this, but these studies show that there seems to be minimal risk.  headaches, nausea, vertigo.  long term exposure is hard to quantify.  The 1-4% concentration in this, coupled with quick evap..I'm guessing minimal risk. Ethyl Acetate - low risk, related to white vinegar.  used in many food applications 77.1 °C (170.8 °F) Heptane - now we're getting to the part that sucks..those damn long chain hydrocarbons.  98.1 to 98.7 °C;(208.5 to 209.6 °F) although still lower the the keytones.  By using the above product I worry about the ketone and heptane, specifically the higher boiling points.  In order to not damage the THC I believe you'd want to do this under vacuum.  Vacuum lowers the boiling point.  This same brand has another product which has less quantity or less 'toxic' denaturants that may be easier to remove. Using the above, I would still treat it as a quick wash, then evap using fan and low heat until it is a reasonable amount.  Essentially letting the ethyl and methyl out.  that leaves you with 2% - 7% of the shit I don't want.  Gotta read up on polar and non-polar solvents and what each of the above is soluble in.  It could be easy, it could be hard, but I am not a chemist either and I don't want to take the time.  I'll attempt to find the right denatured alcohol. I also heard that the yellow bottle of ISO-HEET (gas line antifreeze/moisture remover) is actually almost pure (99.9x%) Isopropyl Alcohol.  Might be another option.  OH... and the local liquor store actually does have everclear.  I just had to ask.  I now have a handle of 95% ethanol..  Seriously though, there is tons of reading on potential products.  The key here is polar vs non-polar and learning how to get rid of the baddies while retaining the goodies.  Certain solvents grab the THC easily, but also start stripping the chlorophyll easily too.  Lots of the 'tanes' are good at just the THC.but.. BOOM!  Really, everything is probably flamable.","so what we are gonna need are brand names or whatever for these fancy non iso solvents of yours; and maybe some clue where to get em, (ie: go to home depot and buy x cleaner)"

I'm no chemist, so I'll likely be not doing the denatured extraction again unless I can find a product that has easily extractable baddies.  I believe plain ketones are easy enough to remove.  Once you get into the higher temperature boiling point compounds (Hexane, Heptane, who knows what else) then it seems like it becomes counter productive since you may actually be harming the THC.","Pyro, have you extracted kief?

I prefer wax in a wax pen when I don't need stealthiness.","Quote from: skrillexcanna on August 09, 2014, 06:19:03 pmQuote from: PyroWolf on August 06, 2014, 01:08:49 pmQuote from: skrillexcanna on August 05, 2014, 03:29:10 pmAnyone know what a cold vaporizer (it doesn't heat up) can be used for?gonna toss out a guess, based on author & context -how about evap for piss extractions?       /ducks and runs like helllBahahahahaha!/smokes and flies but forgets why he was chasing the WolfMeh I think I'll stick to ecig fluid then.

The grease is from previous 710 adventures. I chose that particular container for visual clarity, because my others are darker. I was just too lazy to clean it properly before the photo op, perhaps next time stage on parchment...  2.  Poor lighting also contributed to how dark it looks, combined with the lowered rez pic. In the original, and if you look closely at the edges of the slabs, you can see translucency and a hint of it's true color.   3. Those pieces were placed standing up with clear sharp edges to demonstrate stability. When breaking off chunks, the only hazard is pieces of hash flying aross the room or putting an eye out. Technique is important here!  4. Unsure of strain, as the leaves were a gift from a friend who didn't indicate; however it has been my experience that, unlike BHO, with ISo extractions, strain doesn't have much impact on outcome consistency. The above demo was merely proof of concept.  The main things that effect both the quality of product and yield for any polar solvent is - method, input material condition and prep, and the right tools for the job. Before a couple months ago, I was a newb at this stuff too!  Other than that, the best tip I can offer is one that has been a guilding principle thoughout my life -   Tenacity is the salvation of the mediocre mind and the lazy disposition.  You can quote me on that   "," Also Pyro, your qwiso looks pretty good but is it stable? It looks a bit dark and greasy, with oil on the container. Just askin', not knockin. You know I am a newb on this stuff. What strain was teh herb?"

The VG takes like a month and they put a paper bag over to protect from light but set near a window for heat. PG I would expect to perform sort of like a weak ethanol tincture. There's a thread on grasscity about getting oil into solution with vg/ethanol/water, but some of what they say seemed iffy and it wouldn't be that strong if you need it to work in 1-3 hits.  It was me who said I can clone Ejmix. I'm pretty confident I can unless they are lying about what is in it, just don't have concentrates to experiment with. I would start with 1/3 each PG, PEG 200 and PEG 400. There should be no need at all for PEG 300. If you wanted VG, sub it in for PG or the PEG 400, then find the ideal blend to get as much BHO as possible to stay in solution.  edit: Also Pyro, your qwiso looks pretty good but is it stable?

I've been around since the original SR days but never had a chance to try out ECC. Before I placed my order I did a lot of research across markets in order to locate *the best* bud and came to the conclusion I needed to try ECC, Buttonwood or Muskabuzz. I'm glad ECC was my first choice. I ordered on Wed. night and package was in my hands Saturday. Awesome. Stealth was quite good and smell is a non-issue until you get to the innermost layer. When I opened the last layer my nostrils were met with a wonderful lemony/diesely/skunky musk. The buds were glistening. I tore off a small pinch and it just stuck to my hand lol. No shit. The smoke is somewhat expansive but is smooth and well cured. I only took a couple hits but after about ten minutes I was feeling fantastic. Heady high with no anxiety/paranoia (which I am sensitive to) and a deep euphoric body buzz. The strain is definitely a mood elevator. This is some seriously well grown herb (kudos ECC). I've been smoking for the past twenty years and only one or two other times have I come across dank like this. I'm looking to forward to getting some more and trying out some of their other strains.   Prost!",

The sample arrived in the US after 10 days in a standard sized airmail envelope with the buds pressed flat, vacuum sealed, and sandwiched between a layer of cardboard stock. No odor was present at all from the outside. 5/5 for packaging/stealth.  The buds were slightly sticky to the touch and carried a pleasant, perfumy scent that wasn't overly strong. After running them through a grinder, there were only a few bits of sticks and stem to pick out -- but really, these were well manicured buds.  I rolled up a gram of the ground bud into a RAW cone and smoked it with one of my homeboys. The best part about this smoke was the amazing high -- this stuff is strong! The high was euphoric, uplifting, and spurred laughter and good conversation. The only downside was that it was a bit harsh on the throat and lungs -- you will definitely do some coughing. I think this would make a great party smoke, either uncut or blended with a smoother strain.  Final verdict: partially it depends on what strain this was, as AfriKanSun sells a wide variety ranging from $90 to $195 per ounce. My feeling is that this particular flower competed well with typical ""mids"" sold on the darknet for around $160-180/ounce, with a stronger high than most of those, but with a slightly harsher smoke. I feel like this could be an excellent value, and potentially an amazing value.   Thanks AfriKanSun!   ",

If that still makes sense, I made cannabis oil from AfriKanSun's Ama Special weed using BadKittySmiles' recipe (  http://www.thctalk.com/cannabis-forum/showthread.php?60297-Bioavailable-Medical-Grade-Oils-Edibles-Drinkables-amp-More-from-guru-BadKittySmiles ) I used it two times to test for potency and it worked wonders. Probably the thing about sativa giving you sleepy vibes is the time I used to cook stuff (recipe has cumulative cooking time of 2 hours) which probably helps to turn some THC into CBD. Anyway, I recommend you to try it with Ama Special or MamaKa.","Hey AfriKanSun, I would be super happy to get a sample and either way probably be placing an order in a few days.

When you click place order the funds are held in escrow, which means CR holds your money in a separate account, until you release the funds to the vendor upon completion of the sale. The funds in your wallet can't be used for multisig.  Multisig is a deal where the market, the vendor, and the buyer each provide a key which generates an multisig address. It takes at least 2 of the 3 parties to finalize. This protects the buyer against a scamming vendor (unlikely on cr) or a crooked market operator, (VERY unlikely here)  Basically everyone who has a stake in the deal is covered because at least 2 or the 3 must agree to release the funds.   Multisig is the future of DNM purchasing, so it is probably best to refer to Crypto's excellent tutorial about it here:  http://forumzxmoorof4ja.onion/index.php?topic=372.0 ",Ok so whats with traditional escrow and multi signature escrow

Sending positive vibrations all around!   Those who are familiar with the original Silkroad v1.0 know me as Ganja Man. I am now vending under my new name - Ganja Merchant. During my Silkroad stint (July.2012-Oct.2013), I have processed over 200+ transactions worldwide with 100% feedback. My products from landrace strains have garnered plenty of rave reviews globally and if you're a cannabis connoisseurs, it's a definite must-try!   Head on over to my vendor page:  http://cannabiskofvl7pa.onion/vendor-profile/GanjaMerchant  Don't forget to click the 'Add to Favorites' button!  PRODUCTS: Superb exotic quality pollen and hash made by the indigenous farmers using landrace strains of the Cordillera Philippines. Grown outdoors with full natural sunlight. Fragrant earthy aroma with hints of pine and freshness, accompanied by mint and citrus terpenes.  Reviews:  ""Nice terpenes and flavours so soft you don't need any heat and its just something different from any maroc or even dutch versions. The plants are indigenous to the Philippines and hence I'd venture to say this is truly a one off venture. Certainly to be taken advantage of if you are a true hash connoisseur. In the last 20+ years I have been around the planet hunting the very best of smoke, I've been to Chefchaouen in Morocco, to Manali in India. Also been up north in Thailand amongst many other infamous places. If you love your hash get your order in now and if you are thinking about well known versions, they can always be gotten and have their own reputations. his is something special and very different try it now I guarantee you won't be disappointed.""  ""Really unique pollen in the best of ways. Reminds me of a high class Moroccan with a softer consistency to Carmelo hash but lighter and fluffier in texture. The smoke was lovely and smooth with a real uplifting high. Was floating nicely in my own little world. Definitely a hash for the hash connoisseurs out there. Overall it was a smooth transaction and Ganja Man couldn't be a nicer guy to deal with.""  ""The pollen itself came in a nice solid lump. It was a bit soft and sticky, and definitely a much smoother smoke. The taste is mild and faintly medicinal in a pleasant way, with notes of horehound, mint and Listerine.  It burns nicely and is very easy on the lungs, without any of that heavy incense quality I've come to associate with hash.  The high is also different: two hits produced a very clear, cerebral and energetic stone with little body buzz and no sedation, munchies or fogginess. As others have said, this is a unique hash and no cannabis connoisseur should pass up the chance to get their hands on some.""  ""Connoisseurs of cannabis really need to pick up a little of this: how often do you get a chance to smoke Filipino hash?  It's well worth the price and the wait, and should satisfy even the pickiest hash-smoker.  It's a good, tasty smoke that will be especially useful for daytime burning, and it's definitely a limited edition product.""  ""I quickly got to work heating up the solid hash and sprinkling it over a screen for consumption. The smell was subtle but very distinct when heated, something like a minty hash. As for the high, it reminded me of a strong sativa, similar to a cup of coffee with a dose of THC induced euphoria snuck in. The high is very clean as opposed to burning herb, likely because there's very little plant byproduct. However I also suspect the clean high is due to the genetics in the Philippines having landrace sativa characteristics. I was high for a good 3 hours. I would recommend this strain for anyone who needs medication without the time to burn down a joint as it hits you quite quickly, or someone looking for an operational high that still keeps you social, in such a place as work or school. This is just one of those products that you have to try: There's simply nothing like it outside of its land of creation.""  ""As a long time connoisseur i must add this to my all time top 10 list and cannot thank you enough for bringing this excellent sativa stone to SR and hence the world. These exotic terpenes are simply amazing and coupled with the clarity and energy of the high makes one super dooper piece puff.""",

I'd like to expand my rating criteria even more so that especially repeat customers can have a really good idea of exactly what they are going to get from a new batch just based on my ratings of it.   Some of the things that customers find important, in my estimation, and soon to be included in new strain descriptions:  Bud size (small popcorn nugs, big chunky, etc.)   Smell, both how it smells and how pungent the smell is, should probably be separate categories. Some people don't care if it's skunky or citrusy or what have you as long as it smells STRONG.   Bud moisture levels. Is it cured, and for how long? Is it still a bit sticky? Some people actually prefer one or the other.  Potency in general, but also specific effects of the high.   Genetics.   Bag appeal in general, and sometimes trim job specifically. Good photos probably make this mostly superfluous.   Customers also occasionally want to know what medium it was grown in, whether it was indoor or outdoor, etc., but I think these are questions better answered by the aforementioned categories.      What do you think about that list? Anything to add? I think it would be great to develop some templates for things like this with the communities help for vendors to use.  Example:   Smell characteristics: Skunky, subtle floral, subtle pine. Smell strength: Very pungent, 9/10 Cure: Three week cure. Potency: 8/10. Long lasting cerebral high. Genetics: (Skunk #1 * Thai)  Bag Appeal/Trim: Hand-trimmed but not manicured, 1-2cm  frosted sugar leaves extend in places, 7/10 bag appeal overall. Bud Size: Large buds, most between 3 and 6""  Smell characteristics: Smell strength: Cure: Potency: Genetics: Bag Appeal/Trim: Bud Size:          ",

I'll bracket the post with lines and then discuss further after.  ----------------------------------------------   Some of our customers have wondered why, for some strains, we offer UV-dried and what I call traditionally-dried* versions of the same strain, and for others we only offer one or the other.  Well, it all has to do with the high.  That's what we're about here at Angel Eyes -- the high, the high, the high**.    In order to explain our selective use of UV while drying our buds, it might be best to explain it in the context of one of our fave strains --- our Grape Bogglegum.      We only sell the UV'd Grape Bog now -- we did a test a month ago or so where we reviewed customer experiences with the traditional Grape Bog (along with my own tests) and we decided that the Grape Bog without UV is kind of jittery, and mildly anxiety-producing.        The truth is that the breeder named Bog who created the Bogglegum ""strain"" is a hack.  Its not really even a strain in that there is no predictability to it -- my friend who is into breeding calls Bog a ""pollen chucker"" because he just throws combos together and never does the hard work of cross, back-cross and counter-cross breeding to get a strain to breed true.  So basically our Grape Bogglegum was a lucky chance.  We even tried to get another plant like it by ordering a bunch more Bogglegum seeds, and none of the plants we grew out from those seeds (I think we got 20 or 30) had anything like the taste and sweet, sticky resinous quality of the Grape Bog.  And even then, when we had such a beautiful, and practically unreproducible plant, the high it provided was a bit anxiety-producing so we had to mellow it with the UV and voila!  A beautiful hack of a ""strain"".  That's why we try to educate our customers that taste, looks and aroma are not equal to a great high.  Of course as weed purchasers we often only have our nose and eyes to judge with.  Unfortunately they are rarely a perfect substitute for actually smoking the stuff.      So now we only sell UV-dried Grape Bog.  Its a fantastic plant with a unique and special high, but it just isn't the same without UV-drying.     *traditionally-dried (or ""regular"") just means dried in a dark room with a temperature of 65-75 degrees, and a humidity around 65%. ----------------------------------------------  So that's why we used it on the Grape Bog.  And it holds true for sativas as well.  A sativa that may be a bit too racy or paranoia-inducing can be tempered with UV, and an indica-dom or balanced hybrid strain can be directed more towards pain relief with some UV applied.   In short, an application of UV tends to reduce psychoactivity and increase the body high.  With the Kali it can take the super potent edge off the strain.  Personally I prefer the Kali regular-dried, but in very small quantities.  I'll take 2-3 hits of a regular-dried Kali spliff and be very nice. With the UV-dried Kali you can smoke more and it won't be overwhelming, but IMO it loses a little of its visual and mental intensity.  As for UV'ing already dried buds, I think it would work although I haven't experimented with it.  I do know that UV'ing during the later flower period should have the same effect as using UV during drying.  Its easier to apply UV more closely during drying which is why we do it that way.  The actual mechanism of UV (which is present in all forms of light to some extent) has to do with the trichomes on marijuana plants.  Many plants have trichomes for different purposes, which look like Triffids from that old film:  stalks with ball heads on them.  On marijuana the trichs come in three stages, clear, cloudy and amber.  Accurate timing of a harvest is done by comparing the ratios of these three, rather than the typical ""75% red hairs"" criteria.  Clear trichs turn cloudy which can then turn amber.  The theory, which I don't believe is thoroughly embraced yet, is that cloudy trichs contain the highest concentration of THC, while amber contain higher amounts of the less complex cannabinoids like CBN.  What UV light does is break down THC into those other cannabinoids, by turning cloudy trichs amber.  Its a process that will occur in a more minor way naturally with longer curing, UV basically speeds up and enhances that process.  So if you could harvest a plant that had 100% cloudy trichs it would likely have very high THC count.  A plant with almost all clear trichs is immature and won't get you very high, and a fully ambered plant will be extremely body-stoney, like Moroccan hash.  Moroccan hash is made from plants that have been cut and left out in the sun for 6 months or longer.  All that UV from the sun during drying and aftewards devastates THC.  I do think there will be diminishing returns attempting to UV dried/cured buds but that doesn't mean it won't have an effect.  That's because there are plenty of cloudy trichs left to amber even after drying/curing, if that's what you're looking for.  Its generally accepted that applying close UV to buds for more than 5 hours won't have any further effect other than to wash out the color of the buds, so we generally avoid longer applications.",

A customer would request buds to be pulled early because they want to avoid the stoney effects of ambering.  If the buds were say, half cloudy and half clear at harvest it would be impossible to reach the ""perfect"" ratios with UV, which are roughly around 30-40% clear, 50-60% cloudy and 10-20% amber at harvest, but one might get closer with some UV (except if most of the cloudy trichs ambered in  which case you'd wind up with very stoney, not very psychoactive, buds).  As for how UV affects different strains, while there is definitely some variation in its effects by strain, the general tendency is to increase the stoney character and reduce the trippy, psychoactive effects.  In other words UV tends to increase the body high, euphoria, pain relief, insomnia effects while reducing the increased heart rate and mental perception changes.  @fordfiesta, hi there!  Welcome to the Angel Eyes thread  .  I'm not 100% sure which tutorial Lupojak is referring to.  I still have a tutorial I wrote up about using GPG from the command line on Linux/OS X, but I've written up a few different ones that I don't have anymore so maybe Lupo has a copy.  If that's the one you'd like let me know and I'll PM it to ya!  -Ava","@Ava:it is always a good read when you drop the knowledge, sister!i should be compiling all these gems into a book, to read again if i ever accidentally smarten up...but i did save your pgp lessons from way back, and was glad i did more than once.so if i understand correctly, in general, the uv turns the trichs to amber, but are the effects is strain dependent, or can generalizations be made about that too? one reason for my curiosity was a while back i saw someone (can't remember now who or where) had some buds they pulled early at patient request, while the trichs were still clear - not sure why anyone would want that - but then backed out, and the vendor was moving the buds at a bargain; so i was wondering if in a situation like that, even assuming the cannabis was properly cured, could it be improved post-production with the application of uv? like up-cycling?"

With pictures you don't need any really fancy equipment. Google for 'photo lightbox' and there are DIY ones or I bought mine for like $20-30 I think. It doesn't matter how nice a shot you take, the size shown on product listings is just too small on CR. I like when vendors put higher resolution photos in the product description even if they aren't great shots.  My lightbox is like the size of a briefcase and folds out to a semi-translucent white diffuser screen all around and comes with 2 small lights. I just set that up and get a nice close shot with my (newish) cell phone. If you use a cell phone, just make sure to strip out the EXIF data.

The rick simpson oil is an amazing product, one dab the size of a grain of rice will medicate the average smoker pretty well. At dispensaries in the area it does go for around $100 per gram. We use actual buds to make it, not just trim.   As for the pics, better pics is something we will definitively do here soon, its just really difficult to take good pictures without the right equipment. I suspect that some vendors use stock photos of buds and claim they are theirs, we like to give them a real shot of our buds even if it isn't that gamourous.  Thanks for the feedback!

Any orders placed after 10pm were not retrieved and now cannot be retrieved, so I'm afraid that they are lost.  To those of you who received your orders two or three or five or ten days ago and never finalized... Well, a situation like this is exactly why we ask you to FINALIZE PROMPTLY once you receive your order. Really, it's not that much to ask, is it? Your vendor is not a giant anonymous corporation like Amazon or Apple that can easily absorb a loss of hundreds of dollars. Your vendor is a regular guy just like you who has to buy groceries and gas and pay the phone bill. Unexpectedly losing a week's income is hard for us, just like it would be for you.

I bumped the forum a couple of weeks ago and as a result I got a free sample of his 'Special One' Swazi weed. I was a bit sceptical at first, 'why would he send we free smoke all that way?' , 'Maybe it's just a way of getting free bumps on a forum?'.  I have to say, I was delighted and excited when an envelope appeared from South Africa to me in the UK, just over a week later.  AfriKanSun achieved what my deadbeat South African father has failed to do for 20 yeards - a crisp envelope, with a South African stamp on it, and noting but love inside.  For starters, the sample that was included is an ammount of weed that will last me a few days, plus free king size rizla. The weed inside is, by appearance, what we in the UK would call block weed; dry, light in colour and almost odourless. Simple outdoor weed with only a couple of seeds. I rolled it up as it crumbled easily into the rizla, a little tobacco and I was good to go. Let me tell you this: There is no weed I would rather have been smoking on this fine sunny day in my hammock. Despite my expectations it was smooth and tasted far stronger and more pleasant than it smelled.   Sure there's crazy strong week out there that'll make you cough like a mofo and collaps into a sticky mess; but why drink strong spirits on a sunny afternoon when you can sip lager?  This was a pleasant body high and buzz. Perfect to chill out and take a load off - and cheap!  I reccomend AfrikanSun and 'Special One', as a toker, of 17 years. Peace bredren.  RoscoeMG ",

I'm a vendor here on CR, and I only do sales using multi-signature escrow.  Multi-signature escrow is pretty new, and a lot of people don't understand the advantages.  I'm going to take the party analogy of this thread and use it to explain the difference between traditional escrow and multi-sig escrow.  The analogy is really pretty dead on accurate.  After reading it, i hope some vendors and buyers think seriously about using multi-sig in the future.  It's the future of bitcoin markets.  it really is.  ***********  THE PARTY *****************  You heard about this party from lots of your friends, and when you get there, it looks even more fun that you imagined.  But before you drop that hit of acid you brought along, it occurs to you that you might want to figure out someplace safe to stow your valuables so you can have fun without worrying about that stuff.  It would be a serious downer if someone picked your pocket on the dance floor.  You have a few options. You can throw caution to the wind and just jump right in, but you've woken up in a daze without your wallet the next morning once before, and are pretty sure that's not the best plan. The hosts who you don't really know (just heard they throw fun parties) are offering to check your valuables at the door.  It looks they give guests a paper claim ticket, put your stuff in a paper bag with your name scribbled on it, throw the paper bag in with everyone elses paper bags in a big closet with a flimsy padlock on the door.  Hmmm.  The closet door says ""traditional escrow --- lots of money and valuables in here"" on the door --- how smart it THAT??  Do you even know if the hosts can be trusted?  Even if you've heard they are trustworthy (from someone you sortof kindof know), they look like they already had too much of the punch spiked with LSD and MDMA (candyflip punch they call it).  This closet analogy is actually a pretty accurate picture of traditional escrow.  It might be safe, the market admins might have good intentions -- or maybe not.  You have no way of really knowing any of that.  You are just asked to ""trust us"",  ""we wouldn't steal your stuff"", and ""our padlock may look flimsy but what do you know about locks -- we're the experts and no you can't look at the lock -- it's secret"".  OK back to the party story... Even if the hosts really are ""good people"", they are having such a good time it wouldn't be too hard for a couple of bad guys to lock the hosts in the closet and take off with everyones stuff (at least that's the story the hosts came up with later after everyone sobered up and realized how bad things were).  Does that sound familiar to any SR 2.0 users?  I was at that party, and the story the hosts are telling about the bad guys still doesn't sit right with me.  Back at the party, luckily you have another option besides keeping your wallet in your back pocket (not so smart) and the paper bag escrow service (possibly even a worse idea).  Some geek walking by tells you that you might want to think about using the valet parking service.  It turns out that  the party hosts have hired a company to provide valet parking for the guests -- you've definitely heard of the valet parking company ""Bitcoin multi-signature Valet Parking Services"".  They suggest you lock your stuff in the trunk of your own car (your personal off-line bitcoin wallet), and give the parking service guys the valet key to your car -- the one that won't open trunk.   You think about it for a second.  Maybe the geek who recommended valet parking was even smarter than he looked.  Sure the valet parking option is a little more of a hassle.  But you'll probably have a hell of a lot more fun at the party if you don't have to constantly worry about your stuff.  Seems to be working for the geek.   He's getting down on the dance floor doing stuff you've never seen before with the hottest dudes and ladies at the party.    If you think about it, this comparison of traditional escrow and multi-signature escrow is pretty accurate.  Multi-signature escrow  is inherently much more secure than traditional escrow.  Instead of relying on a markets admin's honesty,  good intentions and technical skills (??  Crypto is a smart guy, but I know I'm not smart enough about this stuff to know that for sure), multi-sig escrow is built into the core of bitcoin, some of the geekiest and well tested tech out there -- and getting better and more thoroughly tested every day as more and more transactions prove the safety of the underlying code.    If you're a vendor who thinks muli-sig is too difficult to learn and too much trouble, you might want to think again.  If you're a buyer, ask your favorite vendor to at least offer multi-sig as an option.  Vendors who care about their customers should provide the most advanced tools that are available.  And multi-sig escrow is as good as it gets.  Hope everyone had a great 4th of July.  Party on! ","good thread pothead, il add -sheep - the twats thats already out the door with my weed, phone and wallet.:-)"

It asked the question.If you could describe this market as well as all the rest, what kind of personality would each have and how would you approach them (or not) at a party. Here is my take:  CR  The groovy laid back mellow guy everyone likes cause he always has the good weed. But he is kind of new so some people are still a bit hesitant to become his friend.    AG  The big muscular dude in the room. The alpha male at the moment. Serious as a heart attack. He seems to be at odds with SR2  And is becoming a bit battle weary.  Evo     The guy growing more popular. A smooth talker becoming a force just sitting back watching the 2 big guys fight it out, laughing all the way to the bank.  Andro    The guy who is pissed at SR for being a scammer and is taunting his old friend.  Pandora  There is something about this guy I just can not trust, but I don't know what it is   BS       The quiet guy in the room. Dressed real nice, but kind of low key. But a Reliable friend who is always around.  BB      He is a hell of a nice guy. At times you wonder what is he doing here? Shouldn't he be at school? Why this?  Sr2   The guy who seems to have robbed his friends  but denies it, and although he is a core member of the group his popularity fades. He went from great to bad pretty fast. At one point he was the man, the undeniable king. Now he is despised by many, but he still has charm to the uninformed who still are blinded by his old ways.  Those are a few lets hear about your ideas and other markets  ",

Review Thread,Vendors/Official Vendor Review Threads,"Hello everybody! Somebody was kind enough to alert us to all of this speculation. Allow us to address as your concerns as best we can.  Firstly, we want to apologize for being so unresponsive! It's funny how things work out... you do something diligently for a long time to no avail. As soon as you give it up suddenly it becomes relevant. We had checked this forum for a while and seen no activity. Even when we were running smoothly and had good product reviews coming in, nobody was using this review thread. When we were stopped for a while, the last thing we expected was for there to be activity on our review thread. Of course that is when everybody starts messaging. Murphy's Law.  This doesn't excuse our inattentiveness, but we hope it at least sheds some light and understanding on our situation. If for some reason you ever see us being so unresponsive, the quickest and most direct way to get through to us is through BitMessage. We monitor our BitMessages fairly diligently, so we will respond within the day, if not within the hour. Feel free to send us a PGP ENCRYPTED email to  bhogart@riseup.net, as well, if BitMessage is not your thing.  It seems the main concern people have is our different accounts on multiple markets. You have probably noticed all of this ""we"" and ""us"" crap by now, never ""me"" nor ""I."" That is because we are a team of people who know each other and who were doing this separately. We all learned about DNMs together and then tried to give them a shot. After observing for a while, we decided to combine our efforts. At this point, of course, we had several accounts across several markets, and only one of us had the prescience to keep the same identity on separate accounts. We have done what we can to streamline this all and combine them somewhat, but due to exorbitant vendor fees we have decided to maintain the separate identities on the multiple markets.  Why not be public about this on all of our market profiles? No reason other than, why volunteer information? There is something to be said about the value of smoke and mirrors.  The next concern people seem to have is the different prices across multiple markets. That is based off of a variety of factors. To put your minds at ease, we will volunteer them here. Our account on CR is fairly active and self-sustaining already; hence, there is no need for us to give price incentives to anybody. We believe our prices are already very competitive, and our reputation here is already built up.  On Evolution, there is a HUGE user base, a HUGE vendor base, and many more concentrate vendors with better reputations and lower prices. We have NO feedback for oz listings, since we have had no sales. (The only orders have come from people with no purchase history, with which we are not comfortable.) So, we knocked $100 off the price of our oz. to give an attractive incentive to bulk purchasers with a reputation. Once we have some feedback, the price will go up to 790, like on Cannabis Road.  For those who are curious, our recent ""contamination"": We upturned our concentrate container, leaving all of it on the floor. The good news? Plenty of smoke for us and our friends. The bad news? A two week delay in our supply. We are back though! Remember to message us if you placed an order while we were out!  We hope this adequately addresses everybody's concerns!  hps god bless the whole crops and please god dont let me see no cops",

Stealth: 4/5, couldn't expect much more stealth for an order of this size but I still wouldn't feel right about a 5 for the stealth.  Product: 5/5, Excellent amber shatter that is very stable at room temperature. I can mold it with my fingers for a few seconds without it sticking which is a rarity IME with DN concentrates.

I havent had much luck with large tanks for anything other than e-cig juice.  BHOGarts stuff is pretty thick like molassis.  The NV Cali is perfect; just drop a dab in the little chamber every couple of smoking sessions.  In short:5/5/5 for BHOGart.  (4/5 for Cannabis Road for not having a vacation mode) Will order from again. -OhMyMyhttp://cannabiskofvl7pa.onion/vendor-profile/BHOgart"

Now I don't have any ideas how to make something using oil of this concentration.  I ended up making a salad dressing for one serving using half a dose (one teaspoon) to test it for potency. It tasted... Not disgusting, I guess, but rather as a strange spice. Smelled a bit like burnt hair. Wiped the plate with a bread later to waste as little oil as possible. I will probably write back tomorrow, describing how it was.  Also, mr. Cheezwhiz, the weed was being decarbed for two hours cumulatively (23 minutes for the weed, 2x45 minutes for weed + oil).

In my experience working with straight buds in edibles is a little tedious, and has some taste drawbacks as well.  If you mean cooking in oil instead of butter, I don't think this will improve your yield much if at all. Coconut oil does work very well though.  Find someone with the cheapest concentrates while still being professionally produced, this will be the most efficient method of producing edibles. I sell some BHO products myself, but I am not the cheapest.  Good luck in your baking journeys    ",

For such a tiny amount of extract consumed, I felt sedated for about 16 hours (still feeling that afterglow inside my gut). I slept for 10 hours straight, which didn't happen to me for quite a time.  No ""high"" effects though, but mind the (really low) dose. Good for therapeutical use, and as a sleep aid, I guess. I'll try higher dose (3 to 4 teaspoons) next time for stronger effect, but I feel I should leave it to use as a sleep aid and a painkiller (a rather slow one, that is).",

I would agree. If you can get a good price on a good oil, it's the way to go. However, trim is cheap, and it's much easier to decarb the cannabis before adding to oils, or butter. This extra step, make the butter active without cooking so you can just spread on something, and get a nice high. Other wise you need to put the butter in cookie, and cake mixes. I have also discovered how you decarb, can adjust the buzz, by making THCA convert to THC, then CBN. CBN make you laid back, and sleepy. The problem with trim is a strong cannabis taste. I wash my butter until the water is clean. That helps a little.  5 grams a stick seems a low dosage to me. 28 grams per 4 sticks will make me very happy. 1oz per stick when using trim. If you don't see the face of god, you won't care;) At that rate one cookie will put you out if you are a light weight. The object is to break pieces off, and eat slowly.  Candies should be made with hash oil.  Still looking for some good bubble hash, or keif to make some tinctures.  The object here is to be able to decarb with as little plant material as possible. Then mix with 190 poof alcohol, finally filter through a coffee filter. A good tincture is red, not green. Ahhhhh green eggs, and ham in the morning. Better yet, added to hot tea is heaven.",

Rumors abound where he is actually cooperating with law enforcement and many buyers have had controlled deliveries or have been arrested.  So far all of the buyers were buying some serious bulk to sling around their local areas.  Who knows how far down the list they will go or what the threshold is.  Supposedly they have all his records WHICH HE KEPT for bargaining power for just this situation.  Talk about burning addresses.. The affidavit is still sealed so we do not have all the details.  How about CaliGirl?  Believe it or not, CaliGirl was a guy!   He was also VERY VERY sloppy in trying to cover his actions.  From his actions it sounds like he thought that he was untraceable.   I recommend that you read the Fed Agent's affidavit on what exactly happened.    It didn't take much to track that idiot down. This is 73 pages but it is very much worth a quick browse.   http://www.justice.gov/usao/flm/press/2014/May/20140530_Jones_Complaint.pdf  Notable things 1.  bought mailing supplies from amazon using his real info.   Purchased in bulk so that means shipping methods didn't change. 2.  shipped from the same USPS blue box most of the time 3.  Used his own name on business and personal banking accounts that he then used services to transfer money to columbia.  Didn't seem to try to obfuscate anything at all. 4.  Used his own contact info for BTC laundering on localbitcoin. 5.  Bought e-postage using trackable method. 6.  Rotated thru small list of return addresses.  Not only do you have to worry about your own security when ordering but you have to worry about your vendor's too.     I think the lessons to be learned here is to be smart in your dealings AND fret out your vendors before committing to a purchase.  Even longtime vendors can turn or have bad OPSEC.  If you notice this happens to a vendor you've used before maybe it is time to try another?Keep an eye on forums that are either directly attached to a darknet market OR use reddit/r/darknetmarkets (clearnet) and watch for the 'state of the union'.  My belief is that Cannabis Road will be less likely of a target for law enforcement because of the US cannabis movement and exposure that is happening.  However, just because this is a cannabis only market does not mean you are immune.  Be careful.  Be smart.  If it doesn't feel right, ask.

I highly suggest him as a vendor and his product in general.  To start, Im someone who prefers sativa in general, and a high that allows me to be slightly more functional, and I have to say all four strands that this dude offers fill that niche.  All are top quality strains and the only overall feedback I would have is that it could be cured a bit more, but I feel like thats always the case:) Just my two cents  regarding each strain  Orange Kush - this is my favorite of the four when it comes to getting high and spending the day doing chores or other somewhat active duties:)  Great high, solid taste and I felt like it gave me a slight energy boost almost which I fucking love!  Blueberry  - this shit smells exactly like blueberrys the most potent odor of the four and definitely some of the best looking nugs.  The high was less energetic but similarly functional to the Kush  Grape - this is in my opinion the most potent flower of the four.  I felt like it had the most flavor as well.  Really strong, functional head high.  Ended up smoking a joint and cleaning my entire apartment.  Got me extremely high.  Banana - least favorite of the four.  Honestly, more for bag appeal than anything else.  In terms of quality, the flower is not far behind the other three, its just got more leaves and when compared to the other three just isnt as pretty, but it in now way is anything less than Grade A in terms of potency.  In terms of stealth, excellent shipping, timely arrival and just a great vendor over all.  I would highly recommend this vendor and any of the four varieties I was able to sample.  Great product and service all around.

Both of my orders were recieved in 2 days which is a really big plus. They ship from the east coast and if you order before 12 noon eastern time your order will ship the same day. So for all of you waiting for ECC to restock, I highly suggest giving ModernLove a go.  Communication: Haven't had to, package always marked shipped when it was supposed to and arrived very promptly. Shipping: 5/5 Again, both my orderes arrived in 2 days  . Stealth: 5/5 Im not gonna give specifics, but they use many layers of protection and there's no smell until the final layer. Product: 5/5 Their current strain is Green Crack or ""Cush"" as some call it. This is as always my favorite part. Big buds covered in orange hairs and THC crystals. The smell....omg.....the smell. This shit you can smell across the room, very citrusy and fruity smell. The taste is just like it smells, really fruity taste on the exhale like you just took a drink of OJ. One of the main reason I tried out ML, other than the fact that they ship from the EC, was because Ive always wanted to try green crack because of it being a sativa. Ive always enjoyed a nice head high over a body high. GC delivers an amazing head high, it starts off nice and slow and by the time you take 4-5 hits you look around and realize that your alot higher than you thought  . Gives a very clear high and leaves you energized without the sedative effects of an Indica. Great for doing outdoor activities, just to wind down from a long day, or a great day time smoke to help you get through the day. Oh and I almost forgot, this stuff is seriously sticky.

But due to much compression done on the weed on the roads, I basically don't have a choice other than using a grinder. By hand I would have little nuggets in my mix that have me putting more than intended   And it usually also takes ages when done by and because it is compressed.  I just wash my grinder by using a cotton swab (the plastic sticks with the cotton at the end for cleaning your ears). I actually remove the cotton on one side to go through the bottom of the grinder. Which will actually give you a small amount of kief. Once that removed I pur the boiling water inside leave it for a minute or so (drink the shot of weedy water afer   Then use the side of the swap with the cotton to clean through the pyramidal (diamond?) spikes inside.

(also some ABV burps) Wall of text below.  I used 5-6g of light to medium vaped bud (think mid roast coffee at the darkest).  The abv was a big mix of different strains.  I believe they were all mid-high or above quality(ECC, AngelEyes, Chip, domo, and a few not on this market) and lightly roasted..still a good bit of life left. I then melted approximately 2 tablespoons worth of organic coconut oil for about 10-15 seconds in the microwave.  It was just enough to saturate and submerge the abv.  Once it was all absorbed I then put about a tablespoon of lecithin powder in and mixed generously.  For a good measure (that's a pun too) I let it sit for a day before filling the capsules.  I made about 30 size 0 capsules (2nd to largest capsule) using a capsule machine and a cheap pipette that I had to cut off a good portion to make work.  The ratio of bud to oil was about even and I did not strain out the plant matter.  Knowing what I know now, about the only thing I'd change is to find a less messy way of filling the capsules directly.  That might involve straining the plant matter out unless I can get a reliable way to fill without clogging the pipette.  The way I did it left oil on the outside of the capsules.  I can taste it.  Tasting it is not horrible since I generally like the taste of edibles.  Others might want a totally tasteless capsule..if so you'll want to be neat and tidy and not rushed.  I believe it would make a more appealing/palatable capsule.  The strength is just about right for me.  Come up is 1-2 hours for me The first night i had the equivalent of 2 capsules plus cleaning up all the mess with bread and eating it.  Waste not, want not!  I got higher than a kite. 8 or 9/10.  Really good body high.  The mind high I wasn't ready for so that was a bit of a pain to deal with slight naseau, etc.  I think I just had too much for the conditions.  The high lasted for 4-6 hours (lost track of time)  I had 1 capsule about 1.5 hours ago and the come up was/is smooth.  I've got a nice body high right now with enough of a buzz to dull any pains but still able to feel  .  mind high is just about where I think it should be.  Better focus, not tired or having racing thoughts.  Hopefully it will top out just a bit more than it is now.  I will try a few more over the course of a few days to make sure it is consistently dosed and then will probably make another batch with a few tweaks.  Does anyone know if I use the strain method if I should gently warm and let 'cook' the mixture for a few hours to completely extract all the goodies?   ",

Has anyone here tried this or a similar recipe?  I'm looking for information like your personal experience with dosing per cap, how many caps you take to get to X level, and what you think your tolerance is.  Taken from reddit, but this recipe exists in quite a few places.  http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/1acabp/abv_coconut_oil_with_lecithin_my_tweaks_on_bit/  ","My recipe originates from fuckcombustion.com and was improved upon by Bit_Chewy (unless I'm mistaken). I found it originally at /r/ABV Here's my take on the recipe with some slight modifications and detailed instructions.    Grind up your ABV in a coffee grinder to powder, the finer the better.    Place ABV powder in small ceramic container such as a mini crock (like those used in french onion soup). Any small pyrex or ceramic container should work, such as a coffee mug.    Add coconut oil (heat it up to be liquid), pour over the ABV until it's just barely submerged, do not add this all at once, add a little then stir, add a little more until it's no longer a batter but runs freely.    Add soy lecithin granules, about 10% the amount of coconut oil you used.    Place pyrex or ceramic container in an empty crock pot on high.    Cover the crock pot and heat for 1 hour    Stir once then reduce heat on crock pot to low for another 5 hours stir a few times during this process to prevent hot spots.    CONTAINER WILL BE HOT! Carefully remove the ceramic or pyrex continer with a pot holder and transfer to a shallow dish for easy access    Using a spoon or needleless syringe fill gel capsules, I recommend putting down paper towels or news paper for this as it can be messy    Wipe down the completed capsules to remove excess oilNotes: The finer you grind the ABV the easier it will be fill your capsules. I suggest emptying the grinder, stirring and grinding a second time to get any of the larger pieces down to a fine powder, think flour consistency. There is no need to strain out the ABV from the oil unless you're going to cook with it. If you do plan to cook with it instead of filling capsules go with a courser grind so it's easier to strain in a fine wire mesh strainer.NOW foods carries organic non-GMO soy lecithin, I ordered mine on amazon but I'd imagine healthfood and ""whole"" food stores may also carry it. My first few batches were made with Soy Lecithin gelatin caps but these were pre-mixed with glycerin. I'm unsure if the glycerin prevents the lecithin from properly emulsifying the oil or not. I know that it's used instead of PG in ecigarette liquids which is an emulsifier and surfractant / humectant. I'm sure it didn't hurt but my first few batches were not as strong as my more recent ones using dry lecithin granules"

I ordered 5g of the ama special and asked for a sample of the cheaper weed. What I actually recieved was 2g ama and a 2g sample. However I contacted our friend and he said this was a mistake and that he would send out the 5g again, so all's good.  Both strains look and smell pretty much the same, although when I came to de-seed the weed I noticed that there were far fewer sticks and seed in the ama special. The weed itself is dry and crumbles easily. A slight problem with the extreme vacuum packing of these weed packets is that the seeds were mostly crushed, so it was a bit of a pain picking out all the little bits.  I've so far only tried the ama special, which is a nice smoke. AfriKanSun doesn't lie about the quality of his weed. It does have seeds and sticks but it's a nice smooth smoke.  My main issue with this vendor is actually the stealth. I've only ever ordered from within the UK before and the stealth has always been far better. The weed was vacuum packed, but only once, where I would expect double for international shipping. Although the contents of the package were pretty undistinguishable from outside, the return address was pretty suspicious (I'm not going to say why here) for an international packet. It probably didn't help that my two strains came in two different packets, both identical but with different return names and adresses, on the same day. I hope my mailman wasn't paying too much attention! Although my weed arrived ok this time I'd be wary if ordering too frequently if it doesn't improve. Perhaps the stealth for larger packets is better.  Overall though AfriKanSun seems like a genuine, friendly guy, and his weed is easily the quality he says it is.",

Shipping - took a 1.5-2 weeks to SE USA.  Stealth was adequate and you could not tell the contents from the outside.  There was no smell until the vacpac was opened.  Thank you for including the rizlas Product - Just as he describes.  Compressed, some stems, some seeds.  No dirt, no hairs, nothing gross.  The product is dry and almost crumbly.  it was very easy to grind/crumple by hand.  The smell is faint but there.  It is a very pleasing and almost spicy smell.  I'd liken it to an herb you might use for cooking.  Smoke - ( I lie, I have only vaporized it so far).   It is a very pleasing taste and light vape.  I've used both a butane powered hammer and an electric vapolution vaporizer.  The vapor taste was sweet with a bit of spicy.  Even on higher temps it never became too harsh.  Not too offensive for people nearby.   I will try it either in the papers or in a glass pipe soon.  I think it'll make a pleasing smoke.  Effects - I've only vaped a small amount at once.  I'd say it's not strong at all, nothing like the top shelf dank.  That's OK, because he's selling African Bush weed.     Very much so a light head sativa high.  It gives me the feeling of the light buzz from a xanax or a stiff drink.  Very functional if I'd want it to, a bit relaxing if that's the need.    If you're in the market for this type of product I'd say AfriKanSun is a good vendor to try from.   His prices are great for a product that he tells the truth about.   My only hesitation I would have at all is worrying about international orders and US customs.   This is just a personal feeling and has nothing to do with the AfriKanSun himself.  If you order it, he'll ship it and is happy to make you happy.   ",

The shipping time was very fast, though I tend to have a quick postal service most of the time. I felt totally comfortable placing an international order after seeing communication from AfriKanSun plus all of the positive feedback, and I don't feel let down.   The stealth wasn't as extreme as some people like it to be, but with the price we're paying, and the fact that it always makes it, I think it's about where it needs to be.   The buds were very compressed, but it's not an issue as long as you have a grinder. Pay attention stoners: YOU WILL NEED A GRINDER. It makes it a little harder to judge the amount you're grinding up, but I'm just nitpicking here. The compression seems to benefit the stealth anyway.  The weed itself, well I'm almost too stoned to type this, and I smoke daily. It's got a more pronounced Indica effect than I'm used to, but I normally only ever smoke Sativas. It feels like being wrapped up in a very comfortable blanket. The Sativa effect is still noticeable though as I seem to have developed an understanding of Jazz music.   Given that you can get 10g of this for slightly less than what it costs for 3.5g of ""high grade"", this is a great option.  ",

Stealth was great, shipping was fast. The price is okay. He had some higher grade stuff up, but that seems to have gone now (it was pricey).    Petch: Small time grower, doesn't always have stock, but when he does it goes fast, stealth was good as was the weed. His prices are reasonable for domestic.  1ndica: Seems pretty darn good so far. Stealth was good, speed was excellent and the weed is slightly cheaper than street price. It's not tippity top shelf, but it's well above mids.   boomers: Just selling cannacaps (Sativa or Indica) at the moment, stealth was the best I've seen for a domestic order, and I've just taken a capsule so I'll be back in a hour to give my review. Edit: boomers also has a bunch of legacy sales from Pandora and Evo.   Then the ones I haven't tried yet:  SkyVype: Only offering grams of hash at the moment, though he does have some weed on Evo. 5 finalised sales and no feedback might look dodgy, but with 166 legacy sales from Evo it's more likely people FE'd or forgot to leave feedback.   Griffin: Currently selling pinapple chunk in grams or eighths. 300+ Legacy sales from Agora plus two positive feedback here on CR, could be a safe bet. Around £12 per gram.  raisins: Set up a couple of weeks ago with some budget skunk, now hasn't logged in for two weeks and is in vacation mode. Mabe we'll see them again, who knows?",

I do appreciate all the feedback I get. And take notice where necessary.  I will say that his, is truly the first feedback I have received, that has raised this particular concern. By far the feedback we have received has been very positive. ( You can look at the feedback we have received, from the other markets places where we operate. and here on CR). Customers  have been satisfied with the stealth and been very complementary.   I suppose the testament to the stealth it is that, his order  was delivered, without raising the suspicions of curious postal workers.  The fact that the elves are getting lashes as we speak, for messing up his order is more troubling.   I take stealth very seriously, and that is seen by the overwhelming majority of positive feedback we get.  We learn and move forward. If something needs to be addressed we will.    I will happily send you a sample of our weed, and you can judge for yourself.   One love     ","I've read only good things about you AfriKanSun.

I know how some newbies are definitely overly anxious about recieving their stuff, but seeing you provide information on any and all delays/issues is really soothing.

Quick Question, when you label a 2-3 week curing process does that process occur after the order has been placed or has the strain already been cured and that is just information regardin the strain.

Two months is the rule of thumb most growers use as the perfect cure-time, but for some purposes a longer cure can be helpful.  In my experience the way curing affects the buds is partly up to the strain itself.  Some strains are augmented with a longer cure and others are a little bit diminished, or at least changed in ways I'm not looking for.  If I was a medical marijuana patient and I was using it for pain I would long-cure the hell out of part of my stash.  And I mean, 4, 6 months of cure.  With any good indica or hybrid strain that long cure will make a very analgesic high.  That long of a cure might also take away some of the flavor and color from the buds, but the medicinal qualities will be magnified.  Its the kind of thing you can save for when pain is really bad as it wil probably be sleep-inducing as well.  I hope that helps!",Quote We've been hoping to offer some longer cure times but the demand has kept us from doing that so far. Anyway I could ask for a special order with a longer cure time? I know how when done properly this brings out some amazing flavors to the flowers.

Instead, we've stated for a long time on our vendor page that our shipping schedule is ""organic"".  We define that a certain way on our vendor page, but here I'll translate that to mean we strive for speedy shipping but its not our first priority.  Fantastic marijuana, handled with patience and care, and delivered safely to your door are our first priorities.  This week we experienced a flood of orders.  And when I say a flood, I mean a flood -- I'm talking double, almost triple, the busiest week we've ever had.  We've almost sold out our entire harvest in under a week.  We did not anticipate this flood and we are trying to handle it as best we can.  On top of this we had a seeding problem with this order, for the first time ever.  The quality is still there, but we are carefully removing the seeds from the buds before we weigh and package so that you will not receive, nor pay for, seeds.  This is a slow, arduous process that has added many, many hours to our labors.  These two things combined have meant that we are experiencing delays above and beyond our regularly scheduled delays  .  We are trying very hard to get all the orders made this week out by Friday or Saturday.  Some may spill over into the new week if they were made in the last few days.  Most all of you have been extremely understanding and patient and I appreciate that very much.  I just wanted to make a more public statement about this issue so those who haven't chimed in or are wondering about their orders can hear from me.",

We reported this on the Agora forums last week in two posts:  ---------  On a slight downer note, and I think I mentioned this upthread here, but one of our Silver Haze plants hermied (developed male flowers) and pollinated some of the current crop.  This means there are some seeds in the buds.  Not a lot, but a few here and there.  Because of this we will be reducing the prices.  Its the same great weed, you may just have to separate out a seed or two here and there (they're not fully seeded like weed we used to get back in the day).  ---------  So, after rather extensive examination of our harvest we've figured out that the only plants with any real extent of seeding are The Big Lebowski and Super Silver Haze.  This is likely because these plants were closest to the Silver Haze that hermied, and so received the most pollen.   Additionally we were planning to offer buds from the two phenotypes of the Silver Haze we harvested, but one of them was directly next to the female that hermied and her buds are just completely seeded, so we're not going to be selling that phenotype until the next harvest of it in roughly two months.  So for now we'll be offering just the ""sweet"" pheno of the Silver Haze which does have some light seeding, and so its price, along with the Lebowski that also has a bit of light seeding, will be at the reduced prices we listed above.  But the other two, the Chemdawg X  G13 and Grape Bogglegum, will be at regular price since they received almost no pollination.  ---------  So that's the story.  I sincerely apologize being so late in posting this here.  I am also going to post a note on our vendor page with a link to this comment.    If anyone has any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact us.  -Ava  P.S.  I just read through this again, and would like to point out one thing I missed, which is that we work very hard to pick out the seeds as we manicure the buds, and we are quite successful at getting most of them out.  You may still find one or two here or there, and if you are worried about smoking seeds you can always cut the buds with a knife before smoking.  A cursory examination after cutting the buds will reveal any seeds we missed.

In a couple months we will also have our Kali Mist, which is a wonderfully potent and special sativa.    Anyhow, check back in a few days and we should have those listings up, along with our two wonderful hybrids -- the Grape Bog and Big Lebowski.  So its gonna be a very high Spring at Angel Eyes!",Hey Angel Eyes.

Are you growing in soil or a soil-less mix or coco?  Unfortunately, I won't be much help with any of those because I've been growing only hydroponic now for 12 years.  I keep my mother plants in coco but I'm not exactly an expert at growing in soil type mediums.  But if you're interested in feedback as things progress I'd be happy to contribute advice where I can.  Or I can just shut up and watch your progress.  Do you have any experienced grower friends in your area that are helping you out or is this all from reading books or the web?  Nothing like jumping into it with both  feet!  With 1000 W light you really have the potential to produce top shelf bud if you do it right.  Best of luck to you.  I look forward to following your progress.

I'm really glad to be here. Crypto, JackBlue, and Multisig Escrow are were it's at.  I decided it would be interesting to post some pics of my first grow as it goes along. Maybe someone will learn something with me or is somewhat entertained by pictures of plants.     They were started in little rapid rooter cubes under a flouresant light. Around 7-10 seeds did not even start. Then, I put them under a 1000 watt metal halide light.  I forgot to keep track of the starting dates and will make sure to take notes from now on. I'm pretty sure I transplanted them into the pots under mh on 7/27.  They did look  bad when I transplanted them. I had them under 24/0 for too long which I thinks stressed them out.  After transplanting them, I also had the light too close and may have burned some of the plants. I think this also stunted the growth for some of them. They dried out, the leaves turned into a yellow canue, and pointed upwards. I probably lost about about 7 plants I'm honestly surprised more didn't die. There was also a little bit of mold. Although,  I'm not sure if that was benefial mold or not.  I then moved the  light away and they seemed to start being healthier and start growing. It was moved to where the glass on my air cooled hood was a few inches past 3 feet away. When the plants got a little bit bigger, they started turning and growing towards the light. Because of this, I lowered the light back down.   Here are some pictures of the little babies. Strains are mostly Dr. Who by TGA/HGNW and TimeWreck by TGA.   http://anonimg.com/img/b43975f80539ba7501a09ee496265af7.jpg  http://anonimg.com/img/cb294f57169d516734747f7fc8902dad.jpg  http://anonimg.com/img/2e6dee8692095031d4bcf3b454971d73.jpg  http://anonimg.com/img/ad0a8118a60356e07117f24600f3b3ff.jpg  http://anonimg.com/img/b44ef53563316b3bbcc298e2f4087f2a.jpg  http://anonimg.com/img/fa0246f56cfa920d17a741877c7f759e.jpg  http://anonimg.com/img/0cdb14aef859461c732c2d7b1c2c6d3c.jpg  http://anonimg.com/img/31c111d35cc4b5c1f40af02a4d620540.jpg  http://anonimg.com/img/11201a2859d6b62a816278bc3c02c4a4.jpg  http://anonimg.com/img/c2dc274e99b1a3e0296077e12cf1fc71.jpg  http://anonimg.com/img/80eefd7f079730edd651e2f5afebf052.jpg  http://anonimg.com/img/748950b747cd5ee364d55064b9cc7efb.jpg   ",

I might hop over to somewhere else for other fun stuff occasionally, but there seems like a lot of good vendors here and no reason to go elsewhere for herb.   My only real complaint is there is too many tasty looking options. I have at least two from far away that look super interesting but I was in a hurry so went more local. I ended up ordering from someone that seemed trustworthy and was suitably verified on another market but was newer here. There's no reviews thread on the forum, but his recent section was packed with good comments like ""overweight"" ""here in 3 days"" ""steal for top shelf at this price"". There was 2 new strains up as of 2 days ago and the reviews were all different stuff from just a week ago.  I'm going to try to help out any little ways I can. Once I get my order, I'll see about getting a review thread up. I also ran into some dumb error with my order (my mistake), so I am going to contact the guy who wrote the tutorials on the forum to improve it a bit.  One suggestion: In the shops let us choose to pick a range like 2g to 1/2 only and then by price. Also, maybe the lotto ticket stuff should be moved to its own section.

Rating  Communication:   10 / 10: Fast response time to initial private message inquiry.   Stealth:   10 / 10:   The outside package had no discernible smell with multiple deep breaths right against the nose.   The package employed multiple methods to resist and/or thwart probing.  That said, CGC doesn't go as far as other vendors reportedly do (which by their own admissions may be ""overkill""), but for the shipping time  the stealth employed was adequate to hold back the monstrously wicked dankness.  For future orders however, I will order on a day that eliminates Sunday as a delivery or ship date and recommend other buyers do the same.  Honestly, it's just too pungent for me to want to risk an extra unnecessary day.   Shipping time:   10 / 10:  Total order period was 6 days from initial order on CR to receipt of goods.  One day of that period included Sunday (as I expected).   Time period was within both the processing and shipping expectations as stated on CGC's profile.   Price value:   10 / 10: I moved to Cannabis Road from IRL purchases as I believe I was being charged a ""grey-hair tax"" by the much younger crowd I was buying from.  In my area, IRL prices for 7g of mid-grade bud was between $90-$110 with no or very little discount for larger buys.  Often the IRL bud would be dry and raked for keif.  In one instance, the IRL bud was raked on a screen so badly for keif that the buds were cubes.   Compared to my local IRL dealers, CGC's $300 for 28g+ of medical-grade was a steal.   Aesthetics:   10 / 10::  The crystals/trichomes gave it a drab-green milky appearance under normal light conditions (e.g. not flash photo).  BlueDream: https://cdn.anonfiles.com/1408746621181.jpghttps://cdn.anonfiles.com/1408794837130.jpghttps://cdn.anonfiles.com/1408794962954.jpgCritical Mass:https://cdn.anonfiles.com/1408791858146.jpghttps://cdn.anonfiles.com/1408795245490.jpg Weight:   11.68 / 10:   1.68g overweight yields 1.68 bonus points.  Blue Dream was 22.68g (0.80oz.) as measured on an accurate balance that was verified with NIST 20g + 1g calibration weights.  1.68g overweight.  Critical Mass was 7.09g (0.25oz.) as measured on an accurate balance that was verified with NIST 5g + 2g calibration weights.  Weight right on target. Quality:   10 / 10: After griding about 3 grams between the Blue Dream and Critical Mass, no keif was present in grinder; the crystals stick to the bud and don't fall through the grinder screen.  Crystal content for both strains was high enough that my SharpStone grinder had difficulty getting it to grind fine enough; it just kept sticking to itself.  Sticky ground product ""flowed like water"" through the fingers (as opposed to an overly dry product that crunches and ""falls like snow"" between fingers).  Blue Dream: It had a strong sour smell; not as citrusy as the Critical Mass, but definitely had sweet fruity undertones.  Smaller buds with almost no appreciable stem content.  Three sets of three ~1 second puffs on a 2/3 packed MFLB vape put me where I wanted to go.  Blue Dream was some of the smoothest bud I've ever vaped.  Absolutely zero throat discomfort; it vapes very nicely and is like breathing air.  The stone provided was very heady and had virtually no body load.   Don't smoke this before bed; it'll keep you awake.  Very mentally stimulating and pleasant.   I found the stone also builds over ~20 minutes before plateauing.  Almost no cottonmouth.  Very minimal munchies are easily managed.Critical Mass:  The bud was similarly crystallized.  Medium sized buds with very minimal base of trimmed sugar leaves present.  Very strong sour citrus smell.  As sticky as the Blue Dream in the grinder.  I found this to be minimally harsh on my throat to vape.  Had to clear throat after each set on the MFLB, but otherwise that's it.  Mild cottonmouth; not bad.  Extreme munchies; EXTREME.  Twice I ate so much I gave myself a stomach ache and I was still hungry. This would be a great strain for a cancer or AIDS patient as everything in sight will be devoured.  More of a couchlock stone. Transaction:   10 / 10   Vendor:   10 / 10:  CGC was helpful and accommodating.   I have read he throws extra weight and samples for first-time buyers, so I'm not sure I'll get the weight boost on my next order, but that was great none-the-less.  I will FE again in the future.",

TOP RIGHT You have access below your Welcome Username to  Your Profile and the  log out button. You'll also want to  check the Welcome phrase you set up in your profile to be sure it's what you set and that you're really where you want to be.    THE NAVIGATION BAR    *HOME Ovious: Takes you to the homepage   *ABOUT US The Cannabis Road Mission statement    *MESSAGES You'll have  your mail box here. If a  small number appears next to MESSAGES in the Nav Bar  you have Mail and should click on the message page   Obviously the number tells you the number of unread messages you have.  I'll explain the message page here so go ahead and  click on MESSAGE (it refers to  http://cannabiskofvl7pa.onion/message )  You'll see next to  Messages : Recipient  Start New Conversation   Recipient is to be  replaced by the username of the person  you wish to communicate with. The other (and  more practical way) to send a message to a vendor is to do it  through the vendor profile's page (will be explained below in the Profile section.)  The same  window opens whatever way used:  SEND MESSAGE TO VENDOR USERNAME  You will have a  first frame with   VENDOR PGP Key and something like this below: -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- Version: GnuPG v2017 MingW32  mQxg(lots of characters)ghaV/cA== =cyYP -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----  If you already master PGP Encryption and Messaging you will find here your vendors key.  Copy it paste it to a .txt file and import it with you PGP program It will be for sending double encrypted messages from your program with both the vendor and your user key rather than using the integrated Cannabis Road encryption system (actually what they recommend)  If you didn't understand crap of the previous paragraph ignore it for the time and read the Tutorial on the use of PGP on Cannabis Road. Just  DON'T PLACE AN ORDER Without using PGP Encryption it's a risk to you and to the Vendor!!!  Below that is the  MESSAGE window:   Type here your messages.   You can send plain basic unencrypted messages for general questions just to speak with the vendor when nothing sensitive is shared (amounts, your address or location, etc...)   BUT The best practice is to first of all follow the Vendors guidelines in his profile if he has any (we'll see below how to get to the Vendor Profile). If nothing is mentionned it is best  to encrypt everything (at least basic encryption - see below) That's why  you'll be needing a PGP Key (see the tutorial on that)   For general non sensitive messages I use just  the basic encryption system implemented on the road that only  encrypts the message with the Vendors PGP Key. Works like this:  Just  type in normally your text in the message box.  Then go to the bottom right of the box and  click on ENCRYPT (ONLY ONCE!).  Your plain  text will be transformed into something like: -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----  hQExx...dgjy= =H3jt -----END PGP MESSAGE-----   That's your encrypted message.   Then Just  press SUBMIT to send the message and it's all done.    For more sensitive information (like your address!!! or discussing stealth),  you'll need to use your own PGP program (I use GNU Privacy Assistant for example and a Tutorial will be on that).  It will allow you to encrypt your message with the vendor and your key making it harder for people to decrypt it basically - safer.  In this case  you'll have to encrypt your message in your PGP program and then  copy paste the PGP encrypted message in the message window and just  press SUBMIT (Do NOT PRESS ENCRYPT IN THIS CASE). Will be explained in PGP tutorial.  Now you've seen how to send a message   Lets continue to where messages live:    THE MAILBOX  Your  Messages should now appear in your mailbox (no In and Out box here just one Mail box)  The  Name of the persons you sent messages to or received from should  appear left.   Next to it the  View Conversation will take you to the mailbox and  show all the message history with that seller. You have the possibility  on that page to  delete individual messages and also the possibility to  send a message to a seller from that thread. A  red color code next to view conversation  indicates unread messages and a  gray color code with ""Replied"" indicates  threads where you are the last to have replied.  Back to the general mailbox,  next to user message history you have a  Delete Button that will delete all messages with the user and  remove the message line from the mailbox. This is a non recoverable action as many actions on the darknet, so be careful.  Next to that  you have the possibility to  mark again a message as unread so it will appear red again next to the ""View Conversation"".   *  WALLET  This is where all the financial part is done:  To explain the wallet concept you need to understand that this doesn't work like ebay or amazon...  Here on CannabisRoad  you first need to load money (BitCoins in our case)  to the website Market Wallet before you can spend it on the site to buy stuff.  There are also some specificities due to the use of Bitcoin as a currency. If you saw an item that costs 100$ the seller set its price to 100$ for him to receive the amount of BTCs worth 100$ at the time of the purchase. So it is actually billed to you in BTC at the current BTC/$ exchange rate that can be found on the left hand side at the bottom of the frames  (prices are also shown in $ and BTC when you place the order.  Since Bitcoin exchange rates fluctuate (sometimes a lot) and that the amount on your wallet is in Bitcoins, Over time you could have your wallet amount that was worth 100$ being worth more than 100$ (not a problem for your purchases..) or less than 100$ (kind of crappy when you don't have enough in your wallet to buy anymore ). It's always  safe to transfer a little bit more Bitcoins than stated on the Product page  in case the rates go the the wrong way to not get screwed when you want to buy your product.  You also need to  bear in mind that there are small Cannabis Road Bitcoin transfer fees, which are stated on the Wallet page also so you need to  take that amount into account when transfering BTC.  When you  deposit BTC into your Cannabis Road Wallet you will actually  receive 0.0001 BTC less than the amount you transfered from your wallet.  When you transfer BTC  withdraw out of the Cannabis Road Wallet into another of your wallets you will  receive 0.0001 BTC less into your wallet than the amount you transfered out of Cannabis Road as a fee.  The  minimum amount you can transfer into or out of your Cannabis Road wallet is 0.0002 BTC (Which would become 0.0001 BTC after the fees).  You will find your  balance statement on this page under  BTC Balance. Your  Bitcoin balance is also converted  in your currency you set in your Profile under  Cash Balance.   Below this you will see  slots for 5 Deposit Addresses (whch are basically like 5 wallet addresses linked to your Cannabis Road Wallet)  They  will initially be empty SO you need to  hit the GENERATE KEY for your Addresses to appear in the boxes that are empty (as many times as you want addresses, max being 5)   They  will look something like this: 1FTYtwG2PR3ruYvtK8tRT2wvbXYV1N4PSK  Above them you will also be able to see the  total amount of BTC transfered to each address. Your generated key will be the  address you will need to type in as a destination address for your transfers into the C Road wallet.   Next to the addresses you have a  x with Delete that will  delete the account line and unlink it form your Cannabis Road wallet.  Be  very careful when doing this of two things: 1/  That all funds you have transferred to your Cannabis Road wallet through this BTC address  have been Fully Processed and have been effectively credited to your account.  2/ Of  never using that address again to transfer BTC to your wallet, because the  BTC would never arrive to you and would be lost to you.    A Few things to know about BTC. When you will  transfer an amount of bitcoins from your personnal wallet or from the site where you bought them to one of the deposit addresses it will have a delay.  It will need a certain amount of ""confirmations"" to allow the transfer. You'll need  at least 3 confirmations for it to be processed in your C Road wallet.  To know when your transfer is effective and complete you need to  go to http://blockchain.info  and  type in the address of the deposit address you used to see the number of confirmations. (or type in this url  http://blockchain.info/address/ depositaddressyouused)  You will see a  new page which will give you the informations you need. You should have your  sending address(es) Green ARROW receiving address and 2 boxes, one saying X (Number) Confirmations (Unconfirmed Transaction at very first) and another stating the amount of BTCs being transfered.  IT IS ONLY  WHEN THE NUMBER OF CONFIRMATIONS REACHES 3 THAT YOUR BTCs WILL BE TRANSFERED AND  USABLE IN YOUR C ROAD WALLET.    WITHDRAWING BTC  Fill in the  WITHDRAWAL ADDRESS with the  destination BTC Wallet Fill in the  AMOUNT TO WITHDRAW  (use the dot . as the decimal not the comma , )  TYPE IN YOUR PIN   -   THIS IS WHY YOU NEED TO REMEMBER THIS AND NOT LOSE IT OR YOUR MONEY WOULD BE STUCK IN YOUR WALLET Type the  VERIFICATION CODE Captcha Click  WITHDRAW FUNDS    * FORUM  Links to the Forum http://forumzxmoorof4ja.onion/  It is most important you browse the forum regularly to read about Vendors and are aware of Scam Warnings or concerns that could exist with vendors. It is also essential you contribute to the forums to make the community safer and stronger as more feedback on vendors comes in on the site and forum. You've entered a bright new world of choice, good prices and 1g being really 1g not .6g... But this is not eBay you need to be careful, use basic buyer common sense (as you would in a thrift store - too good to be true usually is)   * SUPPORT Allows you to  create a NEW TICKET with the Support Crew You'll need to chose the  type of ticket SUBJECT among: -  Account Support for anything related to your account duh... -  Buyer Support for help about buying on the site or reporting problems, bad practices of a Vendor or a Scam,etc... ( DO IT TO PROTECT OTHER BUYERS TOO!) -  Vendor Support - not for you if you're just a buyer -  Wallet Support for anything going on or problem wth your wallet (Don't contact them if it's because your funds don't appear and you still don't have 3 confirmations on blockchain.info...) -  Technical Support If you have some tech problems.  -  Bug Report - If somthing ain't working how it should for the community, it's good to report it -  Feature Request - If you have an idea of a super revolutionnary feature for the site     NOW WE'VE SEEN ALL THIS...  WE CAN GET TO SEARCHING IN THE NEXT TUTORIAL  ",

VENDEUR PREFERE Vous pourrez aussi avoir un accès RAPIDE à vous vendeurs préférés dans le tableau de gauche au dessus des taux de changes du BTC. (Je vous expliquerai plus tard comment faire cela depuis la page de profil du vendeur)   LE TABLEAU DES LISTINGS PRINCIPAUX  Passons maintenant à ce qui se trouve devant vous sur la page d'accueil. Vous devriez voir des listings de différents produits qui sont sélectionnés et présentés de manière aléatoire. Pas le meilleur moyen pour vous de trouver ce que vous recherchez.  Maintenant organisons un peu ça.  Votre filtre apparaît dans le menu PRODUCTS:  Choisissez la manière dont vous voulez que votre recherche soit organisée: Aléatoire est la configuration par défaut mais dans le menu déroulant vous pouvez chosir une organisation par:  NEW/OLD , PRICE (prix en partant du plus haut HIGHEST ou du plus bas LOWEST), SIZE (quantité  Big/Small), BEST SELLERS (meilleurs vendeurs), BEST RATINGS (mieux notés),  MOST VIEWS (les plus consultés), NAME.  La case à cocher SHIPS TO MY REGION (effectue des envois vers ma région/mon pays) est des plus pratiques, puisqu'elle supprimera tous les listings que vous ne pourriez de toute façons pas commander, laissant ce que vous POUVEZ acheter visible. Ce réglage saura ce qu'est votre région/pays à partir du pays que vous aurez entré dans votre profil (Expliqué dans la partie ACCOUNT SETTING du tutoriel précédent.)   Cochez aussi SHIPS FROM MY REGION afin d'afficher les listings les vendeurs locaux uniquement. (Si vous venez d'un petit pays il se peut qu'il n'y aie aucun vendeur local vous n'aurez donc aucun résultat, il suffit alors de décocher la case. De plus certains vendeurs ne communiquent pas leur pays ils pourraient donc être rejetés de votre recherche bien qu'étant locaux)  Cliquez ensuite sur UPDATE. Vous avez ainsi mis en place les filtres de base, cela peut être modifié à tout moment durant la session. C'est réinitialisé sur aléatoire à chaque nouvelle connexion.   Maintenant la RECHERCHE PRINCIPALE DE PRODUITS   CATEGORIES DE PRODUITS  Leur signification est assez claire... Le cannabis est la weed etc. Chaque catégorie permet d'accéder à des sous-catégories en cliquant sur le bouton + à côté de la catégorie. (Certaines catégories n'ont pas de sous-catégories vous serez simplement renvoyés vers ""ALL"" (tous les produits de cette catégorie))  Par exemple : CANNABIS vous donne accès aux catégories: INDICA, HYBRID et SATIVA.  Cliquez simplement sur les catégories ou sous-catégories qui vous intéressent et les résultats de la recherche apparaîtront organisés selon les filtres que vous avez appliqués précédemment.  Le plus souvent il y a plus d'une page de résultats. Vous trouverez l'accès aux autres pages en bas au dessous des listings avec une barre indiquant ""Previous 1 2 ...15 Next"" pour naviguer d'une page à l'autre.  Mainetnant que vous avez cliqué sur search et trouvé les résultats, vous pouvez voir les images et les descriptions de listings.   La DESCRIPTION DES LISTINGS DANS LA PAGE DE RECHERCHE:  *L'IMAGE *LA DESCRIPTION DU LISTING *INFORMATIONS SUR LE VENDEUR avec le nom du vendeur, son feedback(notes des clients) /5 (5 étant la meilleure note) et le nombre de ventes qu'il a effectué sur le marché. *Le PRIX dans Votre MONNAIE (celle choisie dans votre profil - voir le tutoriel ACCOUNT SETTING si besoin) converti à partir du prix en BiTCoin en dessous. *Le POIDS de l'item (souvent aussi mentionné dans la description du listing) Cliquer sur la PHOTO ou la DESCRIPTION vous emmènera vers la description complète du listing. Cliquer sur le NOM DU VENDEUR vous emmènera sur le profil du vendeur avec des tas d'informations importantes (expliqué plus bas dans le tutoriel.)    La PAGE DU LISTING COMPLET:  *Vous y trouverez une grande photo du l'item avec la description et le prix pour la quantité indiquée.  * La politique d'expédition du vendeur: Vers quelle destinations il envoie et d'où.  * Les différentes options d'expédition dans le menu déroulant. FAITES ATTENTION à choisir la bonne option d'expédition pour vous et votre pays. Certains vendeurs offrent aussi un service de suivi, donc assurez-vous de cliquer sur ce que vous voulez vraiment et le plus important sur l'envoi correspondant à VOTRE PAYS.   * ESCROW Type: Escrow Traditionnel (basé sur le site de Cannabis Road) ou Multi-Signature Escrow (pas toujours disponible). Je vous expliquerai l'escrow traditionnel et comment la paiement est effectué dans un autre tutoriel. Il y a aussi un tutoriel pour le multi-sig escrow (escrow à signature multiple) qui est un peu plus compliqué et pas forcément une méthode adaptée aux débutants pour commencer à acheter. Donc choisissez Traditionnal Escrow pour l'instant.  * Quantity: Entrez le nombre d'items que vous désirez (Notez que les vendeurs vendent souvent différentes quantités et que les prix descendent à mesure que les quantités augmentent, vous pouvez voir ça dans les autres listings des vendeurs.)  *Le bouton ADD TO CART (ajouter au panier) fera exactement cela quand vous cliquerez dessus. Vous serez ensuite renvoyé vers votre panier (shopping cart) et prêt à confirmer si vous avez fini votre shopping.  *SELLER (vendeur): Vous pouvez cliquer sur le nom du vendeur pour accéder à son profil de là aussi.  *En dessous se trouve la description complète du produit. Vous trouvez habituellement des informations sur le produit, la métode du vendeur pour rendre le colis indétectable, les délais d'envoi etc.  D'autres informations très utiles se trouvent sur la page de profil du vendeur (Rappelez-vous que vous pouvez accéder au profil du vendeur en cliquant sur son nom en dessous du bouton ADD TO CART. VOUS AVEZ AUSSI ABSOLUMENT BESOIN DE CONSULTER LE PROFIL DU VENDEUR avant d'acheter. (Vous constaterez ici l'utilité des onglets multiples    *En dessous de cela se trouve les FEEDBACK (notes) RECENTS reçus par le vendeur pour ce listing particulier. (Le feedback de vente des autres listings peut être trouvé sur le profil du vendeur)  Et voilà pour la page des listings.  Puisque nous avons de toutes façons besoin de consulter le profil des vendeurs pour de nombreuses choses, allons-y maintenant.   PROFIL DES VENDEURS Cliquez donc au choix: * Depuis la page des listings sur le nom du vendeur en dessous du bouton ADD to CART. OU * Depuis la page des résultats sur le nom du vendeur au dessus des étoiles de feedback. ou * Depuis la barre de recherche en haut en entrant le nom du vendeur et en sélectionnant vendeur dans le menu déroulant.

Crypto: Weve experienced a few new hacking attempts, and were threatened by a few people directly on the Hub to pay extortion fees or else suffer the consequences. I take every threat very seriously and consulted with a few colleagues of mine about the threats and I am happy to say that none of the attempts were successful, and we had refused to pay the extortion fees. But I want to clarify, that I dont believe we are inpenetrable, nobody is perfect, and I want to be humble in that, I will always take every threat, or report of security flaws in our market VERY seriously and investigate it immediately. Also, we do offer bug bounties, so if you discover any security vulnerability, you can contact me and we assess the bug bounty on a case by case basis and the person reporting it will be compensated.    DeepDotWeb:  Also i can only *assume* that from all the current DNMs CR is the lowest priority market in LE eyes, your thoughts about that?    Crypto: I really hope that is the case. Cannabis really doesnt need to be illegal, and already 2 states in the United States have legalized it for recreational use. Were hoping that LE will consider us low priority, but we never let our guards down, just in case.    DeepDotWeb: Anything else we did not mention that you would like to add?    Crypto: Our mission statement  We believe that prohibition against cannabis is inhumane. There are people serving life sentences for simple possession of cannabis in the United States. In Japan, your first possession offense for cannabis could land you 5 years in jail. But cannabis is a plant that has so many useful uses, such as medicine, paper, clothing, fuel, nutrition and we really want to see this prohibiton against cannabis end. We want to educate the public, as much as possible about why cannabis is not the reefer madness drug that it was made out to be. Not a single person has ever overdosed on marijuana that has been documented.   DeepDotWeb: Thank you for your time, and i hope you will succeed with CR!  * * * * * * ",

Unfortunately, your average darknet market user, does not have the patients or at times competence to deal with it. So we decided to build a hybrid system. We were the first market, before Evolution to offer both traditional escrow and multisignature escrow.    Crypto: But then we realized even further, that multisignature escrow has multiple ways it can be implemented. There are easier ways which offer less protection for the users involved, and more complicated ways, which offer the most protection. And we couldnt decide which one to use.    DeepDotWeb: So what did you end up with?    Crypto: So we decided to 3 different options of completing a multisignature payment. These options are offered as a choice to the users involved. I can go through each one briefly.    DeepDotWeb: sure!    Crypto: We like to call it 3 levels of multisignature, because each one is more technical than the last.   All three levels start off the same, asking for public keys of the buyer, vendor and market to create the shared (multisignature) address. The buyer sends funds to the shared address. Once the buyer is happy, the buyer agrees to finalize the order, this is where the 3 levels are offered.  * Once the buyer agrees to finalize, the market will ask the vendor for their private key, that is part of the keypair with their public key used to generate the shared address. Then the market supplies its private key as the second key and the funds are withdrawn to the seller. We call this the private key method. And some of our users are perfectly comfortable with this, but others argue it could give the market the chance to steal their funds. Which is why we offer these next 2 levels as well.  * The second level, is what we call Sign and return: This is the same method offered by BlackBank and Hydra, in which the raw transaction is created, and constructed in a very simple, automated style, which allows for easy copy and paste into your Bitcoin client, adding your private key, and executing the command signrawtransaction. This adds the vendors signature to the transaction, then the vendor returns the partially signed (because it still requires a second signature) to the market, the market adds it signature and will broadcast the transaction on behalf of the vendor.  * The final level, we call Broadcast: This is where the market adds its signature first, and constructs the transaction in an easy copy and paste format for the vendor to add their own second signature. Instead of returning the transaction which has 2 signatures added to it, the vendors at this point have the fully unlocked transaction, in which they are able to broadcast it themselves from their own Bitcoin client by executing the command sendrawtransaction  This is the method offered by TheMarketPlace and I believe Evolution. This gives the users the most feeling of security that the market never has the fully completed transaction in their hands but is also the most complicated for your average user.  Our biggest challenge has been keeping everyone happy, and I feel that offering all the options people want and giving THEM the choice is the way to go. We havent finished the new tutorial yet, but we do have someone working on it.   ",

When it was established, for what purpose, what happened since etc.?    Crypto: Cannabis Road was established back in early February, by Don Cannabis, who is like our Defcon, but he really didnt have much knowledge relating to the technical aspects of running a market, so he went out and found a few programmers to try and get this thing off the ground. The first programmer ended up scamming him and taking his money, the second programmer ended up doing a similar type of bait and switch by demanding more money and eventually leaving when his increase in fee wasnt paid. Finally the third developer was brought in, and this is the one that had no darknet experience at all. This developer made textbook newbie mistakes such as directly using GET and POST requests in their database queries, which is a big nono for any experienced developer. He was however, good with layout design. In fact, your article on DeepDotWeb outlines pretty much every mistake this original developer made. And within about 1 week, they had attempted to launch an unfinished market. They wanted to start building up a member base, despite not even being able to process payments at that time. It was a complete disaster, with a market full of security holes, and information leaks.  Within about 7 days, the entire database was dumped and deleted and the original developer was instructed to take down the market so they could fix the problems. This is when people who were actually knowledgable in the field started contacting the people involved in Cannabis Road, such as Don Cannabis, and saying you need a lot of help. It seemed that there were some highly technical people, who liked the idea of Cannabis Road, and thought that a cannabis only market was a great idea and offered their help. Mainly, the first recommendation was to fire the original developer because he obviously had no clue what he was doing. Some of these people included well known users on reddit, but I wont mention their names.   ",

Crypto: We plan on implementing the vendor directory API under development by El Presidente, so that people are able to identify vendors on our market with established vendors on other markets and view their stats and verify their PGP keys all from our market. I feel that market segregation is hurting our cause, and the cause of the other markets as well. We should all work together, and by implementing these stats, we are saying, that we recognize other markets right to exist and prosper.    DeepDotWeb: You are also on Grams i assume?    Crypto: Not yet, but weve been contacted by them, and plan to get on Grams soon.    Crypto: Another thing I want to mention Is that since our launch, we held a 4/20 raffle with EastCoastCollective, who is our most popular vendor and he gave away 3 prizes. (1) One ounce (2) Half ounce (3) Quarter ounce    Crypto: This month we are featuring AngelEyes, who will be giving away, I believe the same prizes And now, because of the success of these raffles, we will be featuring a new vendor every month in a raffle that will be giving away FREE cannabis to those who enter it.    DeepDotWeb: What are the vendor bonds / fees / FE policy / Scammers status on CR?    Crypto: Vendor bonds are 0.5 BTC for unestablished (new) vendors. If a vendor comes to us from another market, and has at least 20 finalized sales with unique feedbacks, we usually will waive the bond. Especially if its on a big market like Agora or SR 2    Crypto: FE policy is on a case by case basis, but there is no restrictions for established vendors to finalize early. But if we suspect something is off, we may temporarily revoke your ability to finalize early until some of your orders have finalized, but this is rare. We have had a few scammers since our launch, this mostly happened before we implemented vendor bonds, and hasnt happened since. Commissions are 4%    Crypto: We had about 2-3 scammers, but they were stopped before any significant money was scammed   ",

(auto pgp, encryption etc.)    Crypto: Well, one of the main things that the original developer failed to do was hash passwords. We do that now. You mention auto pgp. This is one that we have received criticism for, but we do have an on-site feature which does allow on-site PGP encryption for when users send messages for between each other, and one for encrypting their addresses when checking out their orders. I would like to point out that we mention in big red letters, that the use of this feature is for convenience only, and it is recommended for you to be PGP encrypting your personal information on your own computer, preferrably while offline.  And related to PGP, we REQUIRE addresses to be PGP encrypted, otherwise the order will NOT process under any circumstances.    DeepDotWeb: What is the current size of CR in terms of users , how many listings etc? (if you want to tell us)    Crypto: Our official launch, we like to say was April 20th, although we were in prelaunch for about 2-3 weeks before that. In that time we have about 435 listings, and well be hitting 10,000 users by the end of May. Not bad for around 1 month. I have been blown away by the reception we have had from the darknet community.     DeepDotWeb: Yes it was pretty welcoming  And i can tell you why     Crypto: Please do.   DeepDotWeb: Because you (or the admins) were honest about the issues  Apologized and took the market down, to come back when all was fixed  While most other admins did the exact opposite when they were hacked, Especially at the time when it happened when 4 markets were getting hacked every week.

Crypto: You must, absolutely be always learning new aspects of programming, security, networking, development. New bugs, new vulnerabilities are always being discovered, the most recent big one being HeartBleed. And if you arent staying up to date with the types of vulnerabilities, your market is going to suffer at the hands of those who are up to date. In the case of our original developer, he didnt even know about preventing simple SQL injection.    DeepDotWeb: Oh so the problem was beyond just not being a deepweb skilled developer  but more like just not being a skilled developer at all.    Crypto: In our case, yes. BUT, had he some knowledge of the deepweb, he wouldnt have hard coded the servers IP addresses into the source code for everyone to see.    DeepDotWeb: Ok, And after he was gone what happened?    Crypto: So after he was fired, I was contacted by Don Cannabis, out of the blue and offered a position to develop at Cannabis Road, this was about 1 month after the original market take down. I had demonstrated at least some knowledge about operating in the deepweb, and they were looking at new developers to pick up the pieces. I wasnt the only one who was contacted but, the smartest people on the deepweb, are smart enough to stay away from developing and administrating a market.    DeepDotWeb: And than it was completed in another month. and went smooth from there?    Crypto: Yes, I started developing 14 hours a day. I completely rewrote the code from the ground up. The only original code I kept was the layout itself, because I think it looks really good, But other than that, it was a complete rewrite.   ",

Crypto: I go by the online handle Crypto, Im a programmer/developer and I was brought into the Cannabis Road project a little over 2 months ago. I was basically brought in to pick up the pieces, left by the original developer and fix that developers huge mistakes. And Im now the lead developer of Cannabis Road. The original developer no longer has any involvement, official or unofficial to Cannabis Road, nor was he ever involved publicly in any way. He never had an online handle, he was exclusively behind the scenes as a developer. He had no experience with the darknet, and had no place developing a market like this.  ",

Cops who are out in the streets, know for a fact that cannabis doesn't cause even close to the same problems as alcohol, meth and heroin.   I have spoken with police about this matter and in many cases unless you're blatantly smoking cannabis in a children's playground or rolling a joint on the stairs of city hall, you usually get told to move along or at worst they confiscate it. Of course, trafficking is treated a bit differently, but you get my point.  It's not worth an officer's time to go bush whacking to find what may be 10 - 20 plants of outdoor bud. They have more important things to focus on, such as people excessively speeding, driving drunk, high, or stoned, violence, trafficking, etc....

DPR 2.0s retirement concludes a tense period for the site. In December, two alleged Silk Road moderators were arrested and indicted on drug, hacking, and money laundering charges. Following these events, a spooked DPR 2.0 even imagined he saw FBI cybercrime agent Chris Tarbell. (Tarbell led the investigation and arrest of Ulbricht.)  In the throes of paranoia, DPR 2.0 destroyed his computer, went on the lam, and left his staff with these words:      I don't know how long I will be walking free but we live and we die, and this is my legacy. Keep the road going...      ...this project is what I will always be associated with and the fact it didn't burn down with me is testament to the idea I have lived and will die for.  Once the fog of paranoia cleared and it became evident that the arrests were limited to the two moderators, DPR 2.0 returned. As Senior Silk Road staff member DoctorClu told Ars, He resurfaced a short time after [disappearing], sending messages with a unique cryptographic signature to prove his identity and restore his access to the site.  Paranoia is hardly unusual on the darknet (the informal name for the host of websites not accessible to ordinary Web browsers). The space always seems to be swirling with intrigue and suspicion. This very suspicion may have been what drove DPR 2.0 to make the most controversial decision of his tenure.  Though DPR 2.0 ran a site for which anonymity was paramountmany dealers and customers wouldnt trust it otherwisehe was not keen on extending that same anonymity to his staff. In a private forum accessible only to Silk Road employees, DPR 2.0 demanded they send him their encryption key along with its associated password, which would enable him to decode their communications. DPR 2.0 wrote:      Failure to do so will mean automatic expulsion from the staff team. There is absolutely nothing you should have which is beyond our privilege to view so if such an occasion arrives it is likely because we are making an investigation into somebody you have previously talked to (even if it was months ago so let us know when your last key change was if we ask).  The spectrum of staff responses to this assault on their privacy echoed the broader public debate on privacy and the NSA. They ranged from servile loyalty (Hugs to ya DPR) and terse obedience (Message received), to measured opposition (BOTTOM LINE isGot it. But I will say this...) and firm denunciation (I find this request to be disturbing). DPR 2.0 countered that nothing personal should ever be disclosed anyway and personal contacts be kept separate from official duties. He explained that his main area of focus is keeping law enforcement off our backs and alluded to some disturbing intelligence I am not comfortable disclosing. The Silk Road leader continued:      I would not be asking you this as an off-hand comment or to investigate a minor issue, and this is certainly not a judgment I have made without weighing in the factors you have already raised. Our enemies are cunning and operate in closed-rank secrecy, and so to counter the threat all available intelligence must be accessible.  Senior staff member Stealth stood up to DPR. I never agreed as part of my employment to hand over a private key or password either, and frankly I find this request to be disturbing. The irony of an anonymous marketplace infringing on employees' privacy was not lost on staff member DoctorClu either. DoctorClu countered:      The regurgitation of 'If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear,' is the excuse always thrown at us following catastrophic events. My response to this has always been 'In that case, I will be placing a camera in your shower. You have nothing to hide so there shouldn't be a problem with this.'      Privacy is a right we deserve.      hell, PGP [a type of encryption many on the darknet rely on] stands for 'Pretty Good Privacy'. You are essentially telling us that we should not have privacy on the forums. You control it going forward. I know this is blunt, but we hide on an anonymous network and have worked very hard to secure ourselves even further on it because we cannot maintain privacy on the clearnet. Now this privacy is once again in jeopardy on an environment that was established as safe.  DPR ended up quietly dropping the matter. No one was punished for failing to send over their encryption keys. A ""brilliant"" man  Despite this controversy, staff still have some affection for their former boss. For instance, Stealth, the same staff member who likened DPR 2.0's demand for their encryption keys to the NSA, nonetheless described DPR 2.0 as generous and a sincere believer in the radical freedom of transactions that Silk Road represents to its proponents. Further Reading How the feds took down the Dread Pirate Roberts  What he wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.  DoctorClu agreed that the former leader could be quite generous, recounting the time a staff member was drafting plans for a new security network. The employee asked DPR 2.0 for his opinion, but DPR 2.0 gave more than that. According to DoctorClu: DPR2 replied, 'Send me a wallet address, I will throw you a couple coins.' After he did, the next morning $15,000 was in his wallet.  DoctorClu also said that whenever someone was in trouble financiallystaff and vendors alikeDPR 2.0 would help them out. DoctorClu estimates the Silk Road leader spent a total of around $100,000 in such cases. When people would prove to us that they were in danger, DPR gave whatever he could, DoctorClu said.  Despite such moments, staff also describe DPR 2.0s hubris and arrogance. DPR 2.0 once blithely announced to staff that a competing anonymous market called Agora is going down for simply posting unsolicited adverts for their site on Silk Road forums. The pretext upon which he wanted Agora's site hacked was so apparently flimsy that the hacker DPR 2.0 paid to carry it out ended up resigning in disgust.  DPR 2.0 could also be authoritarian, casually dictating to staff what they weren't allowed to do without first asking for input. For example, he once privately informed staff:      As moderators, your role is explicitly to moderate the forum and no further duties unless requested. You should not be undertaking 'investigations,' trying to drag up any dox or information, or commenting on theories flying around the forum. All such matters and information should go straight to myself & Defcon which you can do by making a topic addressed to us and encrypt it to our PGP keys. Communicating with people outside of SR forums on such matters is still outside of what duties you have been asked to perform and is still in violation of the principle.      Staff should not be sharing information with each other regarding such theories of whatever 'dox' somebody has sent them, this comes to me and Defcon without fail and isn't a topic for discussion.  DoctorClu described DPR 2.0 as brilliant, egomaniacal, and paranoid. He elaborated: ""As you got to know DPR2, you could tell very quickly that he was a brilliant man. When you began to learn more about him combined with how he spoke, his hubris turned him into somewhat of an egomaniac. After his disappearance, his true paranoid side came out.  Defcon, Silk Roads interim leader, is a hacker whom staff describe as more technically capable than his predecessor. Whether or not Defcon will don the black mask of Dread Pirate Roberts 3.0 is uncertain, though the sites attitude about free access to drugs remains: As you wish."" ",

NAVIGATION BAR  *HOME : piutosto evidente, vi porta al' Home Page  *ABOUT US : Presentazione dei missione di C. Road  *MESSAGES : la vostra mailbox si trova qui. Si c'e un numero vicino a MESSAGES nella navigation bar vuol dire que avete un nuovo messagio   Il numero, ovviamente, vi indica cuanti messagi avete ricevuti.  Adesso vi spiego la pagina degli messagi quindi, avanti, cliccate su MESSAGE (vi manda a  http://cannabiskofvl7pa.onion/message )  Vicino a Messages potete vedere: : Recipient Start New Conversation  Recipient verra rimpiazato dal nome d'utante de la persona con qui volete communicare. L'altra manera (piu pratica) per mandare un messagio a un venditore si trova nella pagina di profile del venditore (spiegato piu giù) La stessa pagina si apre qualche sia il método: SEND MESSAGE TO VENDOR (NOME D'UTANTE)  Prima, ci sara un cuadro con: la chiave PGP del venditore et qualcosa che assomilia a:: -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- Version: GnuPG v2017 MingW32  mQxg(tanti caratteri)ghaV/cA== =cyYP -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----        Se sapete già usare PGP et mandare messagi, cuesta e la chiave del venditore.       Copiate/callate la un in un .txt per importarla col vostro programma pgp.              Cosi potrete mandare messagi criptati dal vostro programma, con la vostra chiave et quella del venditore si non volete usare il sistema di criptaggio integrato in C. Road (quello sarebbe pero racommandato        dagli admins del sito)        Si non avete capito un tubo a questo paragrapho, un po di aiuto:       TUTO PGP in italiano:   http://www.tissino.it/docs/pgp.pdf   (!!CLEARNET!!)       DOWNLOAD gpg4usb :  http://www.gpg4usb.org/   (!!CLEARNET!!)       NON ORDINATE NIENTE SENZA USARE PGP, e molto rischioso per vuoi e il venditore.   Sotto c'el cuadro del messagio, dove potete srcrivere il vostro messagio. Potete mandare des messagi simplici con un criptaggio di base per le richieste di ordine generale, si non avete niente di sensibile da chiedere al venditore (sensibile= quantità, indirizzo...) Ma il miglior modo di fare e di seguire le indicazione del venditore sul suo profile si ne ha datto (vedremo piu in giu comme andare sulla pagina di profile del venditore.) Se non e indicato niente e meglio usare PGP per tutto (al meno un criptaggio di base - vedere piu giù) Ecco per che avrete bisogno di una chiave PGP.  Per i messagi generali ecco come funziona il sistema de criptaggio integrato al sito: Scrivete il vostro messagio normalemente nel cuadro, andate in giu a destra et cliccate su ENCRYPT (una volta solo)  Il vostro messagio diventera qualcosa del genere: -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----  hQExx...dgjy= (tanti caratteri) =H3jt -----END PGP MESSAGE-----  Cuesto e il vostro messagio criptato Dopo, cliccate su SUBMIT per mandare il messagio, ecco fatto!  Per scambiare informazioni piu sensibile (vostro indirizzo, o parlare col venditore del método che usa per rendere il pacco o la lettera discreti avrete bisogno del vostro propio programma PGP (GPA, GPG4WIN, GPG4USB...) che vi permettera di criptare i vostri messagi con vostra chiave et quella del venditore, cosi e molto più sicuro perche il criptaggio e più complicato. In questo caso dovrete criptare il vostro messagio nel vostro programme PGP e doppo, copiarlo nel cuadro della pagina MESSAGES  di C. Road e cliccare su SUBMIT (NON CLICCATE SU ENCRYPT IN QUESTO CASO) Adesso che sapete come mandare un messagio , andiamo avanti e vediamo dove si trovano gli messagi:   MAIL BOX  Il vostro messagio dovrebbe adesso essere presente nella vostra mail box (nessun inbox o outbox qua, solo una unica mailbox) Il nome della personna a cui avete mandato il messagio si vede sulla sinitstra.  Vicino ""View Conversation"" vi fa accedere a l'historico dei messagi con cuesto venditore. Su cuesta pagina avete la possibilita di cancelare dei messagi uno a uno e anche di mandare un messagio a un venditore dal filo di cuesta conversazione. Il colore rosso vicino a View Conversation indica un messagio non encora letto e il colore grigio con ""Replied"" indica che sete stati vuoi l'ultimo a parlare in cuesta conversazione.  Ritorniamo a la vostra mailbox principale, vicino a l'historico dei messagi del'utante trovate un pulsante ""Delete"" che cancellera tutti gli messagi con l'utante et rimuovera la linea di messagi della mailbox. Questa e una azione su quella non si puo mai tornare, questo e tipico del darknet, alora, state attenti !  Dopo avete la possibilità di segnare un messagio come non encora letto di nuovo, facendo cosi, riprendera il colore rosso vicino a ""View Conversation.""   * IL WALLET  Ecco dove si opera la parte finanziaria:  Per spiegare il wallet dovete capire que non funiziona come Amazon o eBay...  Qui su Cannabis Road avete prima bisogno di caricare dei soldi (dei BiTCoins in questo caso) nel wallet del sito prima du esser capace a spenderle sur sito per comprare della roba.     C'e anche una specificità dovuta al'uso del BTC come moneta di scambio.    Se avete visto un prodotto che costa 100$ il venditore regola il suo prezzo sur 100$, quindi vi e fatturato in BTC al tasso di cambio BTC/$ che si trova in giù sulla sinistra nella tabella (i prezzi sono anche indicati    in $ et in BTC cuando ordinate.)     Visto che il tasso di cambio del BTC e fluttuante (a volte anche tanto) et che il vostro wallet e in BTC, col tempo si potrebbe vedere il contenuto del wallet prendere valore     (quallo che, in somma, va bene avrete piu soldi del necessario) ma anche perderne (e questo sarebbe veramente un problema.)    Ecco perche bisogna sempre caricare un po più di quello che e indicato sulla pagina del prodotto, nel eventualita di una perdita di valore del BTC.     Dovete anche sempre ricordarvi que ci sono delle piccole spese di trasferimento verso a C. Road, indicate sulla pagina del wallet, dovete anche considerare questa spesa cuando traferite gli BTC.    Cuando caricate dei BTC nel vostro wallet, riceverete in fatti 0.0001 BTC meno del importo totale traferito dal vostro wallet personale.    Succedera anche si addebitate BTC dal vostro wallet C.Road verso un altro wallet BTC.    L'importo minimo che potete trasferire da o verso il vostro wallet C. Road est 0.0002 BTC (Che diventera 0.0001 BTC dopo spese.)   Travate anche vostro saldo su questa pagina sotto BTC Balance. Vostro saldo e anche convertito nella  moneta per quella avete configurato il vostro profile sotto Cash Balance.  Sotto vedrete delle box per 5 indirizzi di deposito (che sono in fatto 5 indirizzi collegati al vostro wallet C. Road) Queste box sono vuote al inizio, avrete bisogno di cliccare su GENERATE KEY per far apparire gli indirizzi nelle box vuote ( potete rifarlo ogni volta che c'e bisogno, maximum 5)  L'indirizzo vostro assomilera a: 1FTYtwG2PR3ruYvtK8tRT2wvbXYV1N4PSK Sopra si vedra anche il totale di BTC trasferito su ogni indirizzo. La chiave cosi generata sara l'indirizzo che bisogera copiare/incollare come indirrizo per traferire BTC verso il vostro C. Road wallet.  Vicino a questi indirizzi c'e una x con Delete che cancellera l'indirizzo e sua collegazione al vostro C. Road wallet. Facendo cosi dovete essere molto attenti a 2 cose:  1/ Che tutti BTCs che avete trasferiti sul vostro C. Road wallet con questo indirizzo siano stati integralmente trattati et creditati sul C. Road wallet.    2/ Di non mai piu usare questo indirizzo per trasferire degli BTC nel C. Road wallet vostro, perche questi BTC non arriverano mai et sarano persi per vuoi.  Altre cose da sapere su gli BTC: Trasferire un importo BTC dal vostro wallet personnale o dal sito dove avete comprato BTC verso un indirizzo di deposito (C. Road wallet o altro) prende un po di tempo, non e instantaneo.  La transazione dovra essere confermata 3 volte per autorizzare il trasferimento verso il wallet di destinazione.  Per sapere cuando il trasferimento e completo andate su  http://blockchain.info e entrate l'indirizzo di deposito che avete usata per vedere il numero di conferme. (o entrate questo URL:  http://blockchain.info/address/INDIRIZZO DI DEPOSITO USATO)  Vedrete una pagina su quella ci sarano le informazione utile.  Ci sara l'indirizzo da quallo avete mandato gli BTC, une freccia verde, l'indirizzo di deposito et 2 box, una vi da X (il numero) di conferme (Unconfirmed Transaction al inizio) e l'altra vi da l'importo BTC che si sta stranferando.  SOLO DOPO 3 CONFERME POTRETE VEDERE E USARE GLI VOSTRI BTCs NEL VOSTRO C.ROAD WALLET.  RITIRARE BTCs  Compilate la parte WITHDRAWAL ADDRESS col'indirizzo del wallet di destinazione, complilate la parte AMOUNT TO WITHDRAW col importo da trasferire (utilizate il punto ""."" per les decimale e non la virgola.)  ENTRATE IL VOSTRO PIN - ECCO PERCHE NON DOVETE MAI DIMENTICARVELO O PERDERLO SINO I VOSTRI SOLDI RIMANERANO BLOCCATI NEL WALLET Entrate il codice di verifica Captcha cliccate su WITHDRAW FUNDS   * FORUM Link Forum  http://forumzxmoorof4ja.onion/ E molto importante dare une scorsa al forum per prendere informazioni a proposito degli venditore et essere al corrente degli Scam Warnings (alerta a la fregatura) o delle inquietudine che esistono rispetto a certi venditore.  E anche essenziale contribuire al forum per rendere la comunità più forte e piu sicura a misura che arrivano feedbacks nuovi et piu numerosi sul sito e gli forums. Sete apena entrati in un nuovo mondo risplendendo con sceltà, prezzi inetressanti e dove 1g e veramente 1g e non 0.6g... Ma non e eBay, dovete essere attenti, usare il vostro discernimento, si sembra troppo bello per essero vero, alora l'e veramente, di solito.  * SUPPORT Per creare un nuovo TICKET per la support team. Dovete scegliere il tipo di ticket tra: - Account Support per tutto quello che ha da fare col vostro account - Buyer Support per avere aiuto per comprare sul sito o segnalare un problema, pratiche sbagliate di un venditore o una fregatura etc. (FATELO ANCHE PER PROTEGGIERE GLI ALTRI CLIENTI) - Vendor Support - non e per vuoi, vuoi sete clienti. - Wallet Support per avere aiuto riguardo al wallet (Non conttatarle perche vostri BTC non appariscono si non avete encora 3 conferma su blockchain.info) - Technical Support si avete un problema tecnico. - Bug Report - Se qualcosa non funziona come dovrebbe e meglio farlo sapere per il benessere delle comunità. - Feature Request - Se avete un idea revoluzionaria per una nuova feature sul sito.

Before I joined Cannabis road, I was so ignorant about so many things about this plant, I didn't even know how ignorant I was! The amount of knowledge I have acquired by accident, just from taking to smart people and being inspired to search creatively for knowledge in unconventional places...has been transformative.  Unless the tech has taken enormous leaps forward since I was fucking around with them, the vape pen experience of anything with concentrates is shit.. maybe the kisskarts are like christ on a battery, but I gotta taste it to believe it.  The benefits of the vape pens - stealth, convenience, safely controlled doseage blah blah blah, if you wanna stay off the nail & torch routine, get a magic flight launch box with power adapter, whip, and the concentrate trays. Compared to a glass rig, it is actually pretty close, and way cheaper price for quality.  Lifetime warranty and a totally legit dabbing experience. But since I got my domeless nail & rig set up, and learned how to use it, dabbing any other way is like taking a shower with a raincoat.  The nice thing about the JB shatter experience is that I had the flowers and the concentrate that came from them. I could tell the quality of the shatter because it tasted and smelled just like vaping the GSC from the arizer, except wayy the fuck more intense. The experience with TBC's BHO was similar in that I could taste the flower, the purity, and made me realize a lot of the concentrates I got on agora was pure shite.   ",

As for the package itself, the stealth was more than acceptable, the weight was on point, and the buds were some of the best manicured and cured buds I've ever seen. All-in-all, DrG has really proved to me to be a top notch vendor. Someone I have no qualms about recommending.  Comms - 5/5  Shipping - 5/5 (for the reship)  Stealth - 5/5  Product - 5/5",

Great communication, great stealth. That's what I and the rest of the dnm community can now expect from all vendors.  But what sets Dr g apart from the rest? Consistency. I've had 4 diff strains of his work and each one is better than the last. You can feel the pride Dr. g puts into his product and service. He believes in this cause and is helping it with consistent processing and handling. minimal handling of product, dense and thoughtfully cured, no signs of chemical experimentation. This is medicine that also happens to be a hell of a good time.  The AK? A warm blanket feeling on my face for hours. All the snacks/Munchies need a timed vault. Tangerine Dream? Made my partner have the best orgasm ever. The Tahoe/Alien OG? Giggly then nighty night. A complex dark chocolate style feeling. It's my favorite out of the last 20 strains I've had. Yes, I did like ECCS LSD, but I prefer Dr. G's indica doms and reliable business over trying to catch that an elusive unicorn again. It was good, but not that good, guys:) just a really thick sativa.  Anyway, I believe I've said it in many ways, but now I'll be blunt- Dr. g is currently very reliable and provides great consistent product.That's all this old hippie can ask for.   We watch the cannabis titans rise and fall and he is earning his praise. Hopefully he won't allow anything to stop my faith in him. Dr. G is currently my go to guy and he should be yours too.   No, I did not get paid or asked to write this - I believe in giving credit where credit is due. thanks Dr. Greenthumb.",

Communication - 5/5 - Not really needed but the Dr.  answered a question quicikly the one time I did contact him.   Speed - 5/5 - Both times, I've gotten the product shipped to my door within 4 business days of ordering which is pretty darn good.  Stealth - 5/5 - typical stealth that I've gotten from other vendors - I won't go into specifics since that seems to be frowned upon, but there's really no way to tell what's in the package without going through several layers. I wouldn't worry about a postal service mishap accidentally opening the package and theres not way it could be smelled.   Packaging - 5/5 -  No compression to the product - that's not a huge deal to me but if you've recieved compressed flowers before, you know they don't look very appealing.   Products - 6/5 - this is the best part - I've ordered from many vendors and have a great experiences and quaity product with everyone on CR, but there's something about Dr. Greenthumbs offerings that just do it for me. I really struggle to describe the effects of different strains, but both the AK47/BK and GSC were the strongest I've had - also his product looks killer, smells very dank and my orders were slightly overweight each time. His prices are very reasonable considering the quality.   ",

We have a long time customer that claims he orders 2lbs from USA it got seized at customs and he never received a seizure letter or got raided. He said the tracking number stayed active for 6+ months and it just sat in customs. LSD and mushrooms are also a schedule 3. Still to say you do not want the wrong border gaurd to pick up your product or RCMP detective to be on your case as legally it is still punishable as time in jail.  Remember its illegal to j walk its done millions of times a day due to the belief it is not punishable. It sucks when you are the one who gets a cop who is slightly overzealous and hands out a ticket for it. Dealing or trafficking any substance is illegal and though what you offer may be deemed not bad all it takes is a detective who despises what you do and it can get you time in a federal prison. Stay safe and just treat your operation like you will be busted if you do not do everything in your power to avoid capture.  Slow methodical decisions to keep your freedom is needed and I hope we all stay safe. We offer a service that has the potential to end the violence real world drug trading creates though it is a better alternative legally that is not taken into account so keep on fighting for whats right and good cops will soon realize prosecuting DN markets is useless because they are sending the wrong people to jail. We truly are committing a victimless crime and once prosecutors and LE realize this maybe they will grow a pair of real balls and go after the shady men with GUNS and drugs.

State Rep. Pat McElraft (R-Carteret County) introduced legislation Tuesday afternoon hoping to do just that. The bill allows the use of hemp oil for patients who suffer from ""intractable seizures.""  McElraft insists the ""Hope 4 Haley and Friends"" bill does not legalize medical marijuana, rather ""this is only a medicine for these children so that they can develop motor skills.""  ""I am adamantly opposed to marijuana, to the legalization of marijuana,"" McElraft said. ""This is a hemp oil bill that's high in CBD, which is the healing part of the brain. But it's very low on THC -- less than 0.3 percent. You can drink a whole bottle of it and never get high.""  The bill will have to go through two committees before it goes up for a vote in the House. If it passes the Hours, it will go to the Senate and then Gov. Pat McCrory.  ""I am so excited that hopefully we're going to find something that will make their lives happy again and where these babies these children are able to get through a day without a seizure,"" McElraft said.  Some families say they have been waiting years for this moment, and they are anxious, nervous and excited all at the same time. Moreover, because lawmakers weren't moving fast enough, several of them have already moved out to Colorado where it's legal. The Carlins' daughter has a severe form of epilepsy and none of her medications have been working, so they have been waiting and hoping for a lawmaker to take up their cause.  ""The seizures are ripping apart her liver, her internals, and it's just doing so much damage to her,"" Steve Carlin said, adding that he is at his wits end.  Liz Gorman moved with her daughter to Colorado away from her husband in Raleigh after hearing about CBD oil through other families with epileptic children.  ""It's not fair to make her have to be separated from her father any more than we already do as part of his military career,"" Gorman said.  Dylan Morley also moved out to Colorado Springs, but from Wilmington. He said, ""I'd like to see the legislators really educated on the subject.""  The Gormans and the Morleys will also be paying close attention this week to McElraft's bill. If passed, they said they might come back home.  For the Carlins, if the bill doesn't pass, they plan on moving to Colorado.  ""I can't wait around any longer. Tomorrow can be her last, every day can be her last day. Every two weeks Im reading about a kid with Dravet Syndrome, or LGS, dying,"" Carlin said.  A family from Raleigh, is also in the process of moving to Colorado. George Dabaghi and his family are planning to leave July 1st, and said they can't wait for lawmakers to decide. ""Nothing's worked on Michael. We've tried for six years. Today has been rough. He's pretty much had five hundred seizures today alone.""  George Dabaghi said if the bill passes, his family will move back to North Carolina, because all of their friends, family, and support system is already here.   When WNCN talked to a few lawmakers about the bill, representatives like Jimmy Dixon from Duplin County said he would support it despite being against anything related to Marijuana, because he trusts Representative McElraft's judgement. ""I would give serious pause and consideration to those things she introduces"" said Dixon.  Rep. Kelly Alexander (D-Mecklenburg County) also introduced a broader medical marijuana bill last week that covers CBD oil as well.

What most of us forget is that the movement for Prohibition arose because alcohol abuse actually was destroying American society in the first decades of the 20th century, and the strictly-regulated post-Prohibition alcohol market was shaped by still-fresh memories of the pre-Prohibition era.  I believe that such tight marijuana prohibition arose from the crack era and everyone associated these drugs with violence, just like the prohibition of alcohol we faced in the past.",

I hold a firm stance on less government involvement in our day to day lives.  I think about the failures of the war on drugs, alcohol prohibition and multiple other things that escape me at this moment are very apparent.  Trying to control leads to crime, stifled growth, less tax income which they then try to overcorrect by taxing higher.     If we can make something legal and have some controls that are actually enforced then we will flourish in the sense of new markets(not necessarily online), tax revenues and people generally behaving better.  The war on drugs only created a need for more money to pay for its actions, additional crime and lower quality mexiweed.  An open market can be legitimately taxed at a lower rate, remove much of the crime (why would we need mexiweed from a cartel?bye bye cartels/gangs).  Quality actually rises, legit jobs created, additional tax income from legit people being employed by a legit company.    Some of the money not spent on fighting can then be spent on addiction or crime counseling and then the rest could be refunded to us (yeah, right.. get some gov't people in there with balls and MAYBE someday).   End result is less crime, more money available, help for people who need it, hopefully a lower tax rate overall for general population.  I think the legalization of weed should be used as a template for other areas.  Hell, for all I care, if you want to have harder drugs legalized I'm all for it.  Stop fighting it and tax it.  Let people do what they deem appropriate for them.  If they infringe on your rights or harm someone thru their actions THEN deal with that problem.  If someone wants to smoke crack at home then let them.  If they want to smoke crack at home and they let their 2 year old leave the house and run down the street... then we have a problem.",

This last line is huge.  For one, it shows that marijuana legalization is gaining some serious traction.  Second, it shows that public opinion is that marijuana persecution is a very wasteful use of tax dollars.

And shipping was pretty good - about 2 weeks to the Midwest US. That 1 for 1 deal sounds pretty damn tempting! I was just starting to look around for an upcoming order and now I've got to throw this into the pile for consideration.   Happy Madiba Month and by the time you get this it'll prob be Madiba's birthday so celebrate Mandela Day!,

First, thank you for this great opportunity! We very much look forward to working with you.  We are a new vendor to the darknet providing exclusively top shelf cannabis and wax concetrate. As new vendors, we understand that there is a certain level of trust required when buyers take the chance to deal with us initially. We would like to do everything within our power to assure the community that we are honest, trustworthy, and professional. We are only interested in providing quality medicine at a fair price; we're not into scamming people or undercutting the market.   As a gesture of trust and transparency, and as a way to properly introduce ourselves on The Cannabis Road, we would like to offer free samples of our products to established members. If you have made at least 5 purchases and you are eligible to receive a free sample of your choice (flower or concentrate). All that we ask in exchange is an honest review of our product. If you are interested in a sample, please inquire on the market (PGP only!) and not here on the forum.   The purpose of doing this is to establish a relationship of trust with the community here. Nobody will want to buy our products if we have no reviews or prior sales, and we can't get reviews if nobody orders our products. This seems like the best, most up front, and honest solution.  We will be creating an official review thread here as soon as we have some reviews.  Please check out our profile! There you can find our listings as well as more information regarding free samples and our general protocol.    http://cannabiskofvl7pa.onion/vendor-profile/TheSecretGarden  We're also on Hydra! Help us get started there as well!   http://hydrampvvnunildl.onion/vendor/TheSecretGarden.html  Thanks again everyone for your time. The folks here at TheSecretGarden are genuinely looking forward to providing friendly and professional service to the best market on the darknet!",

At first I thought it was a mistake, until I double checked, and triple checked, only to find out, we had in fact been robbed not 15 minutes earlier!All coins were sent to this address.http://blockchain.info/address/1CatnMd3jsEKhwhSLUf8V862im8gBp3NDFAt this point, I still have no idea how the coins were stolen, or who was involved.

On SR most vendors would put their refund policy in their profile. So lets assume a vendor had ""25% refund for packages which tracking shows undeliverable"" in their profile. If this was taken to the resolution/support center, an admin could review the vendor's profile, see their refund policy, see that tracking shows undeliverable, and refund only 25% based upon that information.   Refunds from disputes as well.   On SR there was a way to send money within the site. So for example Cannabis Road User Xyz can transfer funds bitcoin to CR User Abc. These transfers were also reflected in SR's account history page. I don't know if you plan to include that feature but it's something to consider.   Another less important feature that SR had was gift codes. Vendors could supply these codes to their customers and it was redeemable for lets say .1BTC off their purchase.

Excellent!  2. I think you should have more options for refunds.

You can put some parameters that the admins choose worthy and maybe it can be some sort of battle to be on the top 5 board.

I think ideally customers could leave a feedback/comment/review under each category as well, and a vendor's feedback could be viewed from each category.Example:  Stealth: (provide guidelines explaining not to reveal too much information in comments.) x/10  Shipping Speed: (provide guidelines explaining to take into account the vendor's stated timelines and issues out of their control. Give concrete examples of orders that deserve a 1, a 5, a 10. ""1 being the worst possible shipping speed, months or more after initially ordered, 10 being the best possible speed, arriving either right on time or even before it was expected."" Perhaps a 5/10 would be appropriate for an order that was a week late, a 7/10 for an order 3 days late, or some examples to this effect.) x/10  Communication: (not many guidelines needed here, but reminds me that it is important to give people the option of selecting ""n/a"" and/or ""unsure"" or just ""skip"" on any of the feedback categories. also do give guidelines about selecting n/a if there was no communication needed.) x/10  Quality/Accuracy of Description: (potentially two different categories. give guidelines about how 10 is for exceeding expectations, 8 for meeting all expectations, 1 for being some terrible oregano, something of that nature.) x/10  Overall Experience:  x/10    Then take those 5 (or 6) numbers, and average them. Take the averaged number and use that as the displayed feedback score for vendors. If that was done 5/5 would no longer be the standard for 80%+ of vendors (probably a good thing for customers and therefore the market). There will be some blowback, because not every vendor is a 5/5 vendor and in a new system things might sort out into more well defined tiers.    ",

Actually that probably wouldn't matter I'd rather see 1 piece of good feedback than 100 shitty ones.

But then if the system is secret there's no way to tell if some vendors receive preferential treatment from staff. I think it makes more sense just to handle vendors on a case by case basis (as long as there are enough staff to handle it).    Edit: And another thing!

No one will write that much. Best thing is to refrain from numbers and use colour-coded hidden (exact rating value being hidden is important) rating based on 4 types of interactions: - Exceeds expectations: Your order went out better than you thought. Bonus points for vendor. - Just as you expected: Your  order went out good, no more, no less. Vendor's still good. - Worse, than expected: You were disappointed. Bad delivery times, quality of product, etc. Vendor's not that good, yet still somewhat safe to order from. - Complete shit: This vendor fucked up pretty bad or scammed you. This does not affect vendor's karma, but rather flags him with ""strike"" which is visible on vendor's page next to his rating.

I'm confused about the 5 star system. What kind of transaction gets 5 stars? Is it one that's adequate (items arrived unmolested) or is it one that goes above what is necessary and has double the weight and 20 layers of stealth? And what kind of transaction gets less than 5 stars? Does the vendor need to commit some serious offense or would a 2 day delay on shipping be enough?   I'm guessing buyers would rather purchase from a vendor with a 5 star rating and might ignore the specifics of their feedback in favor of other options. But is that fair to the vendor who might be doing just a good a job as the vendors with 5 stars, they just happened to have some picky customers?  Should there be some guidelines on how to use feedback so we all understand what a different number means about a vendor?",

Full disclosure (Tl,doodoo): It is in the record that KM and PW are not exactly gum swapping buddies, why this post is irksome to have to write... However, since spring sprung, KM and PW have apparently both gotten their acts together, with regard to forum behavior, toward eachother at least. Since, PW has noticed several insightful, and even thoughtful posts have come out of the Kwikeemart camp (in addition to a couple d-baggy ones), and have recently come to consider him, kinda sorta, an asset to this community.   The point is that PW is an unlikely advocate of KM.           However, that is what appears to be happening now.   So, to continue:  Maybe kwikee caught ebola?   ...got hit by a bus   ....taken out by competition.   ...Mountie stuck him in a 6x8 box?     The point is, we don't know. What we do know is that they were last active a week ago...customers complaining here and there...reddit all ablaze with exit strategy spec...packs not showing...     OH NO!        1. It has been a week. IF the shit is coming, its from another country for most of you. That takes time, sometimes extra because of mysterious reasons.      Try to take a breath...maybe a bonghit?  Not to make anyone paranoid, but maybe customs seized it.   *Little known fact: USPS needs a warrant to peek in domestic packs, postal inspectors whoever at the border can open whatever they want for whatever reason pretty much. One reason PW avoids international orders, no matter how compelling.   2. This may be profiling, but one thing that jumps out about that list of feedbacks is that the majority of users have less than 5 transactions. Maybe they have been around for years, who knows? WHo cares?  The 1st one admitted to being a noob, so that may be controlling impression , however we all started sometime, and when the PW started running in the dark, it was a stressful place at times; so the 'nervous noob' syndrome may be contributing to the hysteria here.   It is fine to come to the forum to engage in discussion, dialogue, attempt communication with vendor or admin or eachother, rattle cages, whatever. That is why these forums exist. They also are here to serve as a framework for a community.  A community doesn't turn on eachother based on rumor, innuendo, or when things start to look not quite right. We work together to find creative solutions and help eachother out when times are tough.    Like now.  With this Kwikeemart situation.        Before letting this slag-fest go on, I felt duty bound as Helper to at least bring up a couple of relevant points:  This is the money part,  lean in close and pay attention   -  We have seen situations like this happen a few times since playing the bud in a box game. A few scams go down...some really huge ones...also saw the vendor return after an unexplained absence, make corrections, or adjustments, and continue on doing business. while the ones who were crying  SCAM are left looking like doofuses.      That isn't to suggest Kwikeemart, or any vendor would take malicious action based on either of those factors; however, it should give one pause before assassinating the character of someone who has that kind of personal access.   That is just common fucking sense.     So then, let us  try to  hold off on the 'asshole scammer' accusations and  'chickens with our heads cut off' behaviors, at least until all the facts are in.  Just another .0002 btc worth, with <3. /PW   *EDIT> 8.10 couple things occurred to me in the interim:   1. It is not too late to edit feedback and scores, especially as packs start rolling in, as it seems they apparently are...  ALSO,  2. As the customs seizure scenario materializes, it may be time to consider burning your current drop addy and creating another.   ",

Communication: [N/A] I didn't bother contacting the vendor (I didn't have anything to talk about). Though I really appreciate kwikeemart posting here in the forums.   Stealth: [4/5] I'd like to have seen an extra visual layer, but the parcel had zero scent, minimal bud compression and looked the part.   Shipping: [5/5] Order was processed quickly, and arrived (to UK) in the standard time I expect for Canadian parcels (~8 days from placing order).  Bud: [5/5] The buds are smaller than I'm used to, but they're all dense and well formed (crystals and whatnot). And for the price it doesn't bother me (actually, I think there might be less stems this way). It vapes nicely, has a similar citrusy taste to other Sativas I've tried. The high is slower to come on, but when it does get there it's really nice.   Overall: I'm defintely satisfied, everything went great.   Edit: Link removed.",

We'd like to give props to EastCoastCollective and their whole crew, including Haile Sallasie and Crypto for bringing us the first viable cannabis-only marketplace!  The darknet has been in sore need of this, and I raise my jay to a future resplendent with plentiful and varied highs.  If you're not familiar with Angel Eyes (technically ""AngelEyes"" on CR), we're a small collective of marijuana growers that got our start on the darknet early in 2013 on the original Silk Road.  My partner and I have been growing weed for almost ten years now, and the rest of our collective has almost 20 years of combined experience growing all sorts of weed.  These days we only grow indoor hydroponic, occasionally dabble in hashmaking and are starting to experiment with edibles.  Our main focus has been on growing non-commercial strains from the best breeders, and focussing first and foremost on the high before any other considerations.  We believe that pretty buds and high yields are great, but bag appeal and weight can sometimes take growers away from the main point of this whole thing -- smooth tasty smoke and a great high.  We love to grow sativas despite them being more finicky and tricky to grow, because we love the energy of a soaring high.  These days we're growing sativas and sativa-dominant hybrids but are also looking into growing some of the super special indicas out there, and over the next 4-6 months we should have some nice indica offerings.  We also use UV light in the drying phase for some of our strains as it can make for some serious medicine, and it also reduces any potential jitters or speediness that sativas can produce.  Now on to the fun stuff  .  For the raffle, we will be offering up for sacrifice a half ounce each of our Grape Bogglegum and Chemdawg X G13.  These two strains really represent the two poles of our current stable, so they'll be a good place to start for the lucky winner.  Here are the descriptions for these two strains:  **********************  Chemdawg x G13 - Traditional Dried, UV Dried Sativa, Dr Greenthumb 2-3 week cure  Chemdawg, (sativa-dominant 80/20) and G13 (indica-dominant 80/20), both classic strains, combine to give this cross a truly energizing and soaring high with a potential mellow body buzz (if UV-dried) that is unusual for such a strong sativa (while G13 is technically classified as indica-dominant, the phenotype of this cross we grow feels like a true sativa).  The combination of these two strains works very well because, unlike many high THC strains that cause a racy, paranoid feeling, this phenotype keeps you grounded with its warm buzz while your head goes soaring into the stratosphere.  Its a very clean and clear high with heightened visual perception and shimmering, and avoids the heart-racing/paranoia-inducing tendency of many commercial sativas (though lighter smokers should start slow).  It imparts an active and interested motivation, is great for socializing and enhances conversation and thought.  Its excellent genetics and pungent, Chemdawg (pungent, spicy diesel) aroma and taste are hard to beat.  We have both traditionally dried and UV-dried varieties.  The traditional is a very clear headed, up high.  Great morning smoke or when motivation or energy is required.  There is a mild body buzz but its secondary to the head.  The UV-dried version of this strain has more depth, more of a body buzz, and often makes us feel like grinning and laughing like idiots, but still retains some of the clarity and energy of the traditional dried variety, though it does appear the UV finally does coax out expression of the G13 indica base because you can get very nice pain relief and a marvelously meditative high with the UV-dried.  **************************************  Grape Phenotype Bogglegum - UV Dried Sativa-dominant hybrid (Bubblegum by Bog)  2-3 week cure  The Grape Bogglegum is for most of us our all-around favorite.  It can't be beat for its incredibly balanced head and body high.  Its an indica sativa blend, with very special qualities on both sides. This cure has a deliciously strong sweet and fruity aroma/taste and imparts an active head high that makes the world sparkle and fills the smoker with a wonderfully controlled energy and confident mood.  The body buzz is strong and definitely gets you stoned, but without the tired feeling of many strong body-highs.  It won't couch-lock you, or make you dizzy or dumb, and the high lasts a good long time.  The UV dried version of this strain is the one we sell.  It makes the sativa side better (removes some potential jitters without draining the energy) and also enhances the wonderful body buzz that is great for aches and pains.     The Grape Bog is our most visually beautiful and fruity sweet strain.  The buds tend to a light lime green with peach colored hairs and incredible numbers of trichomes that glisten and sparkle in the light.  The ""grape"" part of the name comes from the phenotype we grow, but in my opinion the grape aroma dissipates to a more general fruity sweetness after the buds dry, though some people say they can still smell the grape even then.  **********************                                   )                                (         _____________ )        [_____________#    So vote early and often*   and good luck to all of ya'll!  Cheers, Ava  *So I don't get in trouble with the management, I think I have to state here that only one entry per user is permitted  .",

It is also quite possible they had a shipping error and was intended to return to sender but had to manually sort the package. I know the far majority of packages in Canada are automatically sorted and are viewed from a distance when leaving the country. So maybe if it has a hand written address or too small of font it went to manual sorting and may have been stamped their.  On a side note I have never heard of packages being profiled with a voided stamps stamp. There is definitely a good explanation for it and it is not you are under investigation. They would of seized the package or done a controlled delivery they would not have profiled it and then decided to give it to you hassle free. I would not think to much about it as it does not sound very serious and nothing seems to far out of the ordinary.,"Hmmm.So actually I should be worried about the one that WAS VOIDED then maybe...Thanks for the information!And so I shouldn't resell on ebay the unused canadian stamps then But had I ever went to canada I would have probably reused the stamps there.In my country, if the stamp wasn't voided it's the postmans fault and you could reuse the stamp without any further problem.

It is a federal offense with a minimum fine of a very large amount to try to reuse stamps I believe. So returned mail will be stamped with RETURN TO SENDER and a bunch of other small markings.

Tails stands for ""The Amnesiac Incognito Live System"". Tails is a live system that aims at preserving your privacy and anonymity. It helps you to use the Internet anonymously almost anywhere you go and on any computer but leave no trace using unless you ask it explicitly. It is a complete operating-system designed to be used from a DVD or a USB stick independently of the computer's original operating system. It is free software and based on Debian GNU/Linux.  Tails comes with several built-in applications pre-configured with security in mind: web browser, instant messaging client, email client, office suite, image and sound editor, etc. Tails relies on the Tor anonymity network to protect your privacy online: the pre-installed software is configured to connect through Tor, and direct (non-anonymous) connections are blocked.  Tails is being constantly updated for security flaws - you WILL need to do this all over again soon to stay safe! This comes from the Tails website - ""It's very important to keep your version of Tails up-to-date, otherwise your system will be vulnerable to numerous security holes. The development team is doing its best to release new versions fixing known security holes on a regular basis.""  You will need 2 x 8GB USB thumb drives (4GB may pass), they are very cheap and available almost everywhere.  1 - Download the latest version of the Tails .iso file from here - remember where you save it (latest stable version: 0.19) -  https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html  1a - If you are an advanced user, you can download the cryptographic signature on this same page and then verify the download with the Tails key from here -  https://tails.boum.org/tails-signing.key  2 - Download the latest version of the Linux Universal-USB-Installer from here (latest stable version: 1.9.3.6) -  http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/  3 - Run the newly downloaded Universal-USB-Installer     3a - Read and 'agree to' the disclaimer     3b - Select ""Tails"" from the first drop-down list, it's towards the end of the list (step 1)     3c - Browse to and select the Tails .iso file (step 2)     3d - Select your USB drive letter (format the drive if its not empty already) (step 3)     3e - Click 'Create' button then wait for it to finish. Will be a few minutes at least.  4 - Restart the computer and boot into Tails from the USB drive (see below for details on Booting from a USB drive)  Booting from a USB drive: ------------------------------------- If it does not automatically boot to the USB drive, you need to select the boot order, some newer computers will allow you to select which drive to boot to with a small menu, without changing BIOS settings.  You might instead need to edit the BIOS settings, restart your computer, and watch for a message telling you which key to press to enter the BIOS setup. It will usually be one of F1, F2, DEL, ESC or F10. Press this key while your computer is booting to edit your BIOS settings. You need to edit the Boot Order. Depending on your computer you should see an entry for 'removable drive' or 'USB media'. Move this to the top of the list to force the computer to attempt to boot from USB before booting from the hard disk. Save your changes and continue.  Many Flash Drives ship USB-FDD formatted and some systems will not detect or even boot USB-FDD. Most systems can however boot USB-ZIP, and or USB-HDD. If you are having a hard time getting your BIOS to detect your flash drive, you can try to format it as USB-HDD or USB-ZIP using the BOOTICE program (or similar). (Caution - this is a very advanced program! Use with caution - follow links for the latest version)  http://www.pendriveapps.com/bootice-partition-flash-drive-edit-boot-sector/  For more detailed instruction on how to boot from USB you can read  http://pcsupport.about.com/od/tipstricks/ht/bootusbflash.htm  If you have problems accessing the BIOS, read this  http://www.pendrivelinux.com/how-to-access-bios/  I will not accept donations for this tutorial, I offer this only in hope that more people will start using Tor. If you have excess bitcoins you feel like donating to a worthy cause, please send them to Tor or Tails...  https://www.torproject.org/donate/donate.html.en  https://tails.boum.org/contribute/how/donate/#bitcoin  Tutorial Part 2 - Setting up a LiveUSB version of Tails, then an Encrypted Persistent Volume. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   5 - You should now be presented with a log in prompt for a temporary session administration password - this is reset every time you load Tails, it is optional to enter this, it is used to allow current session access to system functions, if you get any errors about access rights try using an admin password at log in. Also at this point you can optionally select to use a Windows XP camo 'skin' to make Tails look more like XP if you're in a public place for example, this is also optional.  7 - Once Tails is up and running, insert the second USB drive. Click the 'Applications/Accessories' menu, then highlight 'Tails', then click 'Tails USB Installer'.      7a - Click the 1st option ""Clone & Install""           7b - Select your target device from the drop-down menu (your second USB drive!)           7c - Click 'Next', then wait for it to finish (however long to copy about 1gb to a USB drive - usually a few minutes). This will install a new copy of Tails onto your second USB drive, this will be your new proper Tails USB.       8 - Shutdown this session of Tails with the Power Button up in the right-hand corner. Don't forget to take out the FIRST USB you created and BOOT INTO THE NEW SECOND TAILS USB! You can format the first USB drive later on, that copy of tails is no longer required.  9 - Log in to the new Tails USB, once logged in click the 'Applications' menu, then highlight the 'System Tools' sub-menu, then click on ""Configure Persistent Volume"". (The size of the persistent volume is automatically determined by how much left over space is on the USB drive after installing Tails in the previous steps.)      9a - Choose your pass-phrase for the persistent volume - you will need to enter this every time you login to Tails. The persistent volume is an encrypted partition protected by a pass-phrase. Once the persistent volume is created, you can choose to activate it or not each time you start Tails. It is a good place to store sensitive materials. When choosing your pass-phrase remember that short, easily guessed pass-phrases are very easily cracked - it would take one Intel I7 2600k CPU over 200,000,000 YEARS to brute-force crack an AES-256 encrypted 32 random character pass-phrase using lowercase, UPPERCASE, 0-9 & ""$p3c|4!""           9b - Click ""Create"" and wait for it to finish.           9c - On completion, a window will popup allowing you to select what Tails will save in the new persistent volume automatically, internet shortcuts, PGP keys, nudie pictures, application settings etc... I recommend selecting everything.       10 - Close and reboot with your modem plugged in and switched on, log back into Tails with your new persistent volume.       11 - Make sure your modem is plugged in and turned ON! Click the 'System' menu, then highlight the 'Preferences' submenu, then click on 'Network Connections'. Now, only YOU know what type of internet connection you pay for, I cannot help you with that! My personal internet connection was amazingly simple to setup (i was quite surprised by its pre-configured setups, it has many different countries options for local telcos pre-installed).       Another note - Tails is PRE-CONFIGURED to go through Tor! It is pre-installed with Vidalia and a Torified browser called 'IceWeasel'. It SHOULD automatically open up when connected to the internet. If not, Use the 'IceWeasel' browser menu shortcut to get onto the Road. Also, this operating system is NOT persistent for security measures, meaning that any changes you make (that are not saved in the persistent volume) will not be saved on restarting Tails! Example is Desktop Backgrounds and general GUI appearance settings (if you manage to get these settings saved and persistent, please let us know!)  If you have any relevant information pertaining to this topic, feel free to update and improve upon it. This was a response in the original thread (by Meatgrinder) that I feel is worth posting, using the dvd/usb method as an alternative to the 2 usb method of installing Tails.  I did not need 2 USB sticks to make a persistent tails, only 1.  I downloaded the tails ISO, burned it to a blank DVD, left it in the DVD tray and rebooted.  Booted into tails, hit Applications' menu, then highlight 'Tails', then click 'Tails USB Installer' then clone and install (as directed above)  It made the USB stick into a tails bootloader.  Once finished, I plugged the USB into my laptop (the above was done on my gaming/media computer) once booted into tails on my laptop, I went back to ""Applications -> Tails -> Configure persistent volume, chose what I wanted, rebooted and it was done (encryption keys, password hashes etc all saved) tried it on my 3 laptops and my brothers too, all working fine with my tails USB as a persistent volume with files I made as a test. Must have done 30 or so reboots to test it.   Installing tails via VM:  If you don't have a DVD drive or burner or DVD's to burn, but have access to a virtual machine, you could also install tails to USB using the virtual machine. It would go something like this: 1) Download latest tails iso from:  https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html 2) Create a linux virtual machine and point the cd/dvd drive to the tails iso file 3) Boot the virtual machine using the tails iso 4) Insert a USB flash drive 5) Connect the USB flash drive to the virtual machine: it will disconnect from your computer and connect to the virtual machine instead 6) Go to Applications -> Tails -> Tails USB Installer 7) Click ""Clone & Install""   Verify that the correct ""Target Device"" is selected by matching the size of the USB Flash Drive you inserted with what is written 9) Click ""Create Live USB"" 10) Click ""Next"" 11) Once installation is completed, click ""OK""  That's it! Now you can shut off the virtual machine, and your USB flash drive can boot tails on any computer capable of booting from USB  ***Disclaimer I found this on pandoras forum***   ",

Basically you take a 5 gallon bucket with a lid and a net pot (plastic pot the plant fits in that the roots can grow out the bottom of).  You cut a hole in the lid large enough for the net pot to fit in without falling through (it has a lip that will prevent it).  So if you used a 2"" net pot, you would cut a two inch hole in the bucket lid and the net pot with the plant would sit in that hole and the roots would come out the bottom into the water in the bucket.  Germination of seeds can be tricky though, and using rockwool or another grow medium while the roots and leaves begin to grow from seed means you'll need some other equipment aside from a pot and soil.  If anyone would like to start out using any type of hydroponics let me know and I'd be happy to help out with some good links and my own insights.  The main criticism I have of growing in soil is that insects and other detrimental organisms can enter your grow with the soil, which is not that common but if it happens it can be devastating.  A benefit of hydro over soil is that you can really fine-tune nutrient concentration, ph and beneficial microorganisms in hydroponics in a way that is harder to do with soil.  If you've ever seen a hydroponic root ball sitting in oxygenated solution, and the plant above bursting with health, its hard to go back to soil IMO.  One thing I would say is an absolute must for hydro growing is the use of beneficial fungi and bacterias.  Without them you have to keep your grow extremely sterile, which is almost impossible unless you have a lab-type environment you grow in, where you wear special clothes and shoes to enter the grow area and always maintain near perfect cleanliness.  The issue is that the nutrient solution is the perfect environment for anaerobic bacteria to grow, which will rot your roots, bring fungus gnats and generally open your plants up to disease and insect infestation.  If you regularly innoculate your nute solutions with aerobic bacteria and beneficial fungi (called mycorrhizae) your plants will stay healthy and happy and the roots and nute solution will smell like soil.  If you grow using organic nutrient solutions you will have to use beneficials as the roots need them to break down the organic matter into the nutrients they need.  That's what we do and our plants thank us daily  .  Some say that plants grow faster in hydro and that hydro produces stronger weed.  I can't say if this is true as I've never grown indoors with soil.  Finally, one thing I'd add is that unless you do some serious research you should stay away from LED lights for flowering your plants.  Mostly all LED's are crappy, and the fact is that if you used enough quality LED fixtures to grow a comparable area of plants that an HPS or Metal Halide light would cover, your going to wind up using around the same wattage anyway.  That's because the LED's don't have much penetration, so they need to be kept close to the plants to work well, and that means you need more coverage over the entire plant area.  I am still watching the LED space as a lot of innovation is going on there, and one grower I met online that uses LEDs swears that her buds are super resinous and dank due to the LED combination she uses.  I can believe it, but without a lot of research and skepticism, its very easy to get robbed blind by unscrupulous LED manufacturers (they cost a fortune as well -- for high quality LED fixtures you'd spend literally thousands to cover the same area as you would with a $500 setup using HPS or MH lights).  If an LED fixture isn't really expensive it means its garbage, but being expensive is no guarantee of quality either, so its best to just steer clear.  I hope that helps!",

IMO, hydroponics and chemical nutrients, while fun, are just a novelty.  Plants grow in dirt. They have evolved over a very very long time to be specifically adapted to grow in dirt.   Get yourself some good dirt, and let it do all of the work. With good dirt, you don't have to worry about pH, nutrients, additives.   With dirt, if a pump fails or the power goes out, it doesn't really matter...dirt naturally buffers and protects the plant in a way no other medium can.  If you are in an urban environment or do not otherwise have access to ""good dirt,"" you can acquire it commercially. Fox Farm's ""Ocean Forest"" is a very rich blend and a good place to start. Some Ocean Forest with some kitchen compost will grow absolutely amazing plants with nothing but water. Over time you can enrich your soil mix by adding new organic material to it inbetween growing cycles.  Best of luck, it can be an extremely fun and rewarding process, but all too many people try to turn it into a science experiment and then get stressed out.  ",

I'd suggest a much better source of information would be your favorite grower/vendor here on CR.  If you're a customer of a vendor with exceptional product, you know for a fact that they know what they are doing.  And I'll bet most of them would be happy to answer questions and share the wisdom of their experience with people just starting out.  It doesn't matter whether you're one of my customers or not, I'll be happy to answer questions.  And if I don't know the answer to a question, I'll tell you that too, because I'll be the first to admit I don't have all the answers even after 18 years of indoor hydro growing. There is just too much to learn.  Every time I start to think that nothing could surprise me in the grow room, something does.  No BS here.  Any other grower/vendors willing to share some free advice? Maybe we can put together a list of growers willing to offer advice, and maybe the type of growing (soil, hydro, indoor outdoor) and make it a sticky in this forum section? ",

As for info specific to just hydroponic growing, all the grow forums above have tons of info on hydro growing as its very popular, and the Cervantes book has tons of info on the subject.  You can also find a lot of info on the net outside the cannabis world as there is tons of ""legit"" hydroponic growing going on.  One other thing I'd recommend is that you should never, ever buy hydroponic units from a manufacturer.  They charge a fortune and anything they will sell you can be made at home with simple tools and inexpensive materials.  There are tons of designs for creating your own units online as well, and DWC units couldn't be easier to build.  Also, you will likely encounter lots of very strong opinions that this or that way of doing things is the ONLY way.  Growers can be very opinionated.  If something sounds a bit too finicky or twee it probably is  .  If you have any specific questions let me know and I'm happy to help!  -Ava","wow eyes that is a lot of good info!

You mentioned some good links when it comes to hydroponics, you mind sharing as the science is very interesting! ","I agree that hydroponic growing is less forgiving for the new grower.  However, the simplest (and some say best) hydroponic method, called deep water culture or ""DWC"", only relies on an air pump like the ones used in fishtanks, which is normally a rock-solid device, and if it fails the plants won't die for quite some time (until all the oxygen has been taken from the water and then the roots will suffocate, which can take days to weeks).  DWC, in its simplest form, is a bucket with nutrient-filled water in it that you suspend the roots in. Basically you take a 5 gallon bucket with a lid and a net pot (plastic pot the plant fits in that the roots can grow out the bottom of).  You cut a hole in the lid large enough for the net pot to fit in without falling through (it has a lip that will prevent it).  So if you used a 2"" net pot, you would cut a two inch hole in the bucket lid and the net pot with the plant would sit in that hole and the roots would come out the bottom into the water in the bucket.Germination of seeds can be tricky though, and using rockwool or another grow medium while the roots and leaves begin to grow from seed means you'll need some other equipment aside from a pot and soil.If anyone would like to start out using any type of hydroponics let me know and I'd be happy to help out with some good links and my own insights.The main criticism I have of growing in soil is that insects and other detrimental organisms can enter your grow with the soil, which is not that common but if it happens it can be devastating.  A benefit of hydro over soil is that you can really fine-tune nutrient concentration, ph and beneficial microorganisms in hydroponics in a way that is harder to do with soil.  If you've ever seen a hydroponic root ball sitting in oxygenated solution, and the plant above bursting with health, its hard to go back to soil IMO.One thing I would say is an absolute must for hydro growing is the use of beneficial fungi and bacterias.  Without them you have to keep your grow extremely sterile, which is almost impossible unless you have a lab-type environment you grow in, where you wear special clothes and shoes to enter the grow area and always maintain near perfect cleanliness.  The issue is that the nutrient solution is the perfect environment for anaerobic bacteria to grow, which will rot your roots, bring fungus gnats and generally open your plants up to disease and insect infestation.  If you regularly innoculate your nute solutions with aerobic bacteria and beneficial fungi (called mycorrhizae) your plants will stay healthy and happy and the roots and nute solution will smell like soil.  If you grow using organic nutrient solutions you will have to use beneficials as the roots need them to break down the organic matter into the nutrients they need.  That's what we do and our plants thank us daily .Some say that plants grow faster in hydro and that hydro produces stronger weed.  I can't say if this is true as I've never grown indoors with soil.Finally, one thing I'd add is that unless you do some serious research you should stay away from LED lights for flowering your plants.  Mostly all LED's are crappy, and the fact is that if you used enough quality LED fixtures to grow a comparable area of plants that an HPS or Metal Halide light would cover, your going to wind up using around the same wattage anyway.  That's because the LED's don't have much penetration, so they need to be kept close to the plants to work well, and that means you need more coverage over the entire plant area.  I am still watching the LED space as a lot of innovation is going on there, and one grower I met online that uses LEDs swears that her buds are super resinous and dank due to the LED combination she uses.  I can believe it, but without a lot of research and skepticism, its very easy to get robbed blind by unscrupulous LED manufacturers (they cost a fortune as well -- for high quality LED fixtures you'd spend literally thousands to cover the same area as you would with a $500 setup using HPS or MH lights).  If an LED fixture isn't really expensive it means its garbage, but being expensive is no guarantee of quality either, so its best to just steer clear.I hope that helps!"

Yeah I get it the consumer doesn't want to be 35$ poorer but at the same time we don't make money. IF ANYTHING it is a setup so that you can FE with us and YOU WILL get your package no doubt so it is proof of work if you give us a chance that sort of thing, if there is a brave soul out there lol  The best answer I can offer to your last question without giving too much informaton away is that the guy responsible for stealth has a 100% success rate to the UK, therefore the logic is if you can beat the UK, you can beat the US. And the UK was his best customer so he will not be defeated by his neighbour, not to mention he has done the, ""Land of the free"" many many times.  Regardless we got a pretty fair policy if the shipment does get siezed, however, we prefer our customers to get their product and leave us a nice review... espically if it is FE ed.

Now, I only do personal use so it's never tons of money.  If I were a dealer trying to flip I'd have much more concern.  Your explanation on btc direct to the vendor on finalize is a good one.  This also limits their exposure should CR ever pull a SR or BMR, etc.   Not that I think that it ever would..but you can't trust anyone.  Now maybe you need to create an automatic support response that checks if they FE'd and give them a canned response if it is in regard to being scammed.  If they don't like it, they can 'appeal' so that a human can see the ticket but it goes in as a low priority and 'you will get to it when you get to it'.  There's always alternatives, but they may have lost the money entirely.   Sometimes a vendor might just need a nudge from the admin  .  Other times it might just be the admin saying ""yes, you got screwed.  sorry.  we have taken notice and turned off that vendor's account""",Just to add my $0.02 here as well.

It is an address controlled 100% by the vendor themself.  Therefore, once you finalize that order, you can  forget about getting your funds back from the seller if the deal goes bad.

That said, be careful in your car!!!  Vaping is way less obvious and odoriferous than any kind of combustion so that's def the way to go where you can be seen.  I come from a family of stoners.  Well, at least my parents were stoners.  They never hid it from us but didn't approve of us doing such things til we were old enough to be on our own.  That didn't stop me from raiding my dad's stash on occasion when me and buds couldn't find any (a very common occurrence back in the day).  The trick was to take just enough and not too much so he'd notice  .  He eventually caught me at it and I had to do the shame face, etc.  He was always a sucker for me though (love equaled sucker to this stupidly rebellious teenager) so he let me off easy.  The funny thing is most of my friends started smoking in their early teen years and I held off until I was around 16 because it wasn't ""cool"" cuz my parents did it.  Stupid teenager.  Now I totally agree with one of the early posters that 80% (probably more) of what you get is mislabeled.  Unless you are getting from a dealer that deals directly with a grower, or from the grower herself, there is no way for either you or your dealer to know exactly what the strain is.  Also, different grows of the same strain can look and even smell very different.  When we grow from seed the variety we get even in very stable strains can be wide.   So how do you figure out what to buy?  Well, if you can, buy from reputable vendors who either grow or get direct from growers.  They will know what you are actually getting, and even better, they will know the quality and care that was taken to grow the product, which can be more important than the specific strain.  Once you identify your preference for either sativas, hybrids or indicas (and you can obviously have more than one, especially for different times of the day or different functions), the job becomes much easier.  I just love when vendors describe accurately what they have on offer.  I saw TBC's (@TheBestCannabis) vendor page the other day and was very impressed because she (he?) listed alongside the strains the quality of each individual strain in an honest and direct way.  That kind of info can lead to a great and trusting relationship between vendor and customer.  So, once you know what you're looking for, be it hybrid, sativa, or indica, the rest is really very personal, so its hard to take much advice other than to keep trying strains. Of course, even then there can be a lot of diversity between grows.  McDonald's its not.  One key thing to understand about MJ is that there is A LOT of hype around it.  Its the biggest cash crop in America, so you can bet there is  .  We have a post we put up whenever we join a new forum that explains the way the pot biz works, and how to avoid getting sucked into the hype over crystals, dense nugs, etc.  Believe me, pretty buds and a kick-ass aroma/taste are really nice things.  I'd never say otherwise.  But too often I've seen dealers turn their noses up at a plant with a really fantastic high because it doesn't have the right ""bag appeal"".  I just checked and realized we never put up our commercial pot biz post on CR, so I'm putting it up now, here's the link:   http://forumzxmoorof4ja.onion/index.php?topic=43.msg2964#msg2964.",

I decided early on in my 'career' to try to vape as I've never been one to like much combustion.  With that being said, vaporizing seems to be a little bit different of a ballgame as compared to combustion.   I love it for a few reasons and will vape for most of my sessions.  I still believe that smoking still has a place. Vaping is great for flavor.  It is almost like sipping wine or whisky.  Every strain has their own flavors and you don't get the ashtray mouth to cloud the taste. vaping is a mellower high.  I feel it in my head more than my body.  I have to do a bit more to get the body stone and it seems to have a delayed onset.   Don't get me wrong, you can still get to a 10 if you want.  ECC's LSD got me there no problemo.  I think it hits me more in stages and I use significantly less than smoking.    Smoking seems to hit me more all at once - head high quickly followed by the body high.  If that's what I'm looking for then I'll smoke.  less smell - but don't think you are completely stealth.  It'll still be there. you get AVB to make edibles!   It is almost like that saying, ""why fart and waste it when you can burp and taste it?""  (sorry)..  But 2 highs from the same weed!  Since I'm newish I haven't spent tons on equipment.  I have 2 vaporizers.  One is the Vapolution ($100ish,great budget vape, all glass path, not the prettiest thing) and the other is the Hammer (got it on sale for about 70, takes a bit of getting used to, small loads, butane based, good flavor).  I got pretty good deals on them by shopping around and also waiting on holiday sales.  Memorial day is coming up soon so maybe vendors will have coupons and sales?  since i have some basic equipment I take the money i saved and try as many different strains as I can safely/smartly receive.  Samples are usually pretty reasonably priced.  Smallish amounts(say up to a 1/4) are great for trying out to see the differences.   Sometimes I ""buy"" into the hype of popular vendors, stellar reviews, or good prices from reputable vendors and get larger personal use amounts.  It is a nice feeling to have a little stable of strains that I can try and see the differences of flavor and high.  Every night can be different if you want.  I've rambled on enough.  Welcome!  ",

I always thought weed was a criminal drug, therefore lethally dangerous, until I've stumbled upon some articles that stated otherwise (and until I actually got my brain cells work together). Nevertheless, I didn't try weed until 09.2013. Then I ordered some dank indica joints off SR (LightningBud he was), smoked it with my wife, she got completely wrecked, I was buzzed at least, so she hates weed now, and I feel I didn't even try it at all. It turned out bad for both of us. Don't know if I will be able to convince her to try it again - not that I want to, but she needs it, she has gargantuan depression upon her, and she could use some medication. Then I got my hands on some promo kief and cheap bush african Swazi low grade weed and made an alcohol tincture from them. This shit wrecked me quite good, and was a nice addition to other substance (2c-b) I was trying that time (Yes, I was like a kid in a candy shop, poor kid, that is). Nevertheless, I am out of stock now with still no experience in smoking weed properly. A week ago I kicked a hundred bucks outta my wallet, and now I am waiting for AfriKanSun's weed to try.

There's nothing really like it... academically, I know how that shit goes down. Metal gets hot, metal gets soft, then you make it do what you want with a big hammer, right?. But until you actually try it, you don't really understand the experience of it. Pulling a piece of metal out of the fire, glowing so bright you can't even look at it head on. It starts a dull red, then a sharp bright red, then orange, then white so bright you wish you brought a welder's mask. If you're not paying too close attention maybe it sits in there for too long, then when you take it out the metal is literally throwing sparks everywhere, the metal's burning in the air it's so hot. You can see the metal just dripping off, it's pretty much molten. Then you set it on your 40-50 pound anvil, and slam the shit out of this dripping, glowing-white, molten hot piece of steel with a 5-pound hammer until it's the shape you want. Or maybe not, and you gotta heat it up again and start over. At any rate, at this point the metal stops glowing, and you think that fucker's cool now? Damn straight it isn't, when you plunge it into the water buckets that thing spits steam and bubbles like you're trying to cook some damn spaghetti. It's incredible how much heat metal can hold. I swear the water will be bubbling and hissing and roiling for like 15 seconds before it can cool the metal down.   And not to mention these fires, you're standing by them working your piece you know, and these things are burning at like 3000+ in the center. And that's just using coal and hand cranked fans. They throw off so much heat you'll lose your arm hair starting above your glove and going to your elbow. Blacksmithing is such a sensory experience. The heat, the metal clangs, the glow of the metal, the weight of the hammer, it's really something you oughta try if you can. Makes you feel like a total badass bringing home this sweet metal thing you made out of some lame-ass rod or sheet or something. ","..i like big fire, like 3000 degree type shit."

Sometimes some spicy South American food really hits the spot and seems great. Other times that same level of spiciness is unwanted and inappropriate. Or a similar analogy, things you drink with different meals: A glass of OJ may be fine with breakfast, but may be a little weird with your new york steak. Also with music: sometimes jazz can be delightful, sometimes it can be annoying, depending on the mood.  In this way I think different strains are appropriate for different times. When you say that you think a bong is giving you less paranoia than a joint, I would humbly suggest that you consider the possibility you may be eating spicy food one day off a red plate and then eating spicy food on another day off a blue plate and deciding that because you liked the food more on the first day that red plates are better than blue plates, if that makes sense.   Based on the limited experience you've had so far, it seems like you prefer Indica leaning (or at least hybrid) strains, in comparison to sativas. This is considering the general quality of the Sour Diesel and Girl Scout Cookies was about equal. Strong sativas can often be described as a ""racy"" high, which many do find a bit much to handle.   It's a really amazing time to start smoking, the amount of information available to you is astounding and the possibilities are near endless. You're just going to want to try it all. From concentrates to cookies to every strain of buds you can get your hands on, it's like wine tasting, some people happily make a lifelong hobby out of it. Eventually you will find what works for you, because in the end I think for longer term smokers it does turn into something where you are actually utilizing different strains as herbs for different benefits, rather than just smoking a fat bowl to get high with the buddies.   I'm glad you decided to try out my buds, hope they are an enjoyable stepping stone to your broader journey     ","Quote from: dontek on May 17, 2014, 12:45:53 amWelcome. GSC is a great way to get re-introduced to cannabis. What are you looking for recommendations for? Strains? Sativa vs Indica? Vendors? Different ways to medicate?I am mainly looking for some tips on ways of consuming it as well as strains. For instance, Girl Scout Cookies really did it for me -- the other stuff I've tried (sour Diesel, someting else) really wasn't as enjoyable.i also enjoy it from a bong far more than from a joint. From a joint I seem to get more paranoid? Probably unrelated. Either way, thanks again for the help and for any tips, guys. Also, TheBestCanna, I just placed an order! will update on results man! "

I am in my 30s and only recently got into weed. I was brought up in a veyr conservative environment and was very closed minded, so it never really appealed to me... I actually tried it out in college (i think it wasn't very high quality shit) and it didn't do it for me.  Until recently... A friend offered me some Girl Scout Cookies. I can honestly say it turned me around 180 degrees. I think it made me realize I've got anxiety issues that I haven't been dealing with. The relaxation was so amazing, and the next day so wonderful that it made me feel like a new person.   With that being said, I am a total noob. I've recently made a purchase and I am willing to expand my horizons.   Can anyone recommend anything? I was looking maybe into getting a vaping pen or something for my own personal use, because I have little experience with anything else.   Thanks a lot guys!",

It's a shame Royal Mail doesn't offer a signature free tracking option like most countries seem to.   Signatures for DNM packages come across as sketchy because every DNM Forum I've been on has said that a signature is a key part of a CD, and having to sign for a package is an easy way of telling if it's been intercepted.   I can see that having signed for tracking on a package isn't more risky by itself, as long as everything goes right. But I think OPSEC should be based on worst case scenarios.   I'm sort of undecided about this though. Most OPSEC advice is based on the USA's mail regulations and drug laws, so it may not apply to the UK. The one UK bust I did hear about (package intercepted at customs) didn't involve a controlled delivery, just plain clothes officers showing up at their door asking about suspicious packages.   So maybe you're right, I'm not sure, but a lot of people seem to be wary of signing for DNM orders. ",

Proof of posting but not proof of delivery so vendors wont offer refunds/reships with this either. Ordering without tracking , in my book, is just asking to get scammed. Even long term vendors with tons of feedback could be tempted to say something has been sent out when it hasn't and most vendors dont ofer any reship or refund on untracked orders. Far too many things can go wrong with untracked packets. From scamming vendors to robbing postmen, millions of letters , packets go missing ever year going through     royal mail.

I went to the bar he hangs out at again trying to just get some for my friend and I but he kept rejecting me. It's just so frustrating to the point of absurdity now.

This is for 2g of Medical Grade A++ wax.  Communication: N/A - No messages were needed really, as my order status's were updated... Processing within 24 hours, Shipped within 24 hours. I find I only need to message a vendor after an order is placed, if the status doesn't change with in the posted timeline on their profile page.  Shipping: 5/5 Shipping took 3 business days from when it was marked Shipped - which is pretty standard in my opinion, more than 3 or 4 business days and I start worrying!  Stealth: 5/5 - Stealth was adequate, contents were well preserved and protected with usually precautions etc. I would order again with confidence and with out worry.  Product: 5/5, Wax, or shatter if you toss it in the ice box, has a nice light amber shade. Maybe a touch darker than an I.P.A. but not much. Consistancy out of the mail box was a tad gooey, but not overly sticky (was a warm day). I was able to use a tool to pull a pinch out and load it without troubles. I vape'd .2g in my Ti Kiss V2 cart and immediately tasted sweety piney wax, very clean tasting. Held in a nice milky pull and exhaled with delight. With in seconds, I could feel my head expanding and my body relaxing. Also, product was packed in parchment, which is how it should be done.  Overall, I am more than satisfied with CGC's wax, while I'm sampling all the waxy goodness CR has to offer, I will, with out a doubt, be back soon for more of CGC's Medical Grade A++ Wax, you won't be disappointed!",

Order arrived in 4 days.  Quality stealth, layers plus MBB+Vac.    I ordered 14g of wax/crumble.  For orders this size CGC allowed mix-and-match strains.  I got 4 different 1/8th of wax: Og Kush, Strawberry Diesel, GirlScout Cookies, and Super Blue Dream.  Each 1/8th was marked with strain and weight.  All 4 are well purged and fire (taste is delicious).  The Super Blue Dream is the only one that is crumble consistency, so it's the only one I can handle without a dabber tool.  The product doesn't quite look like the picture, but it is quality nonetheless.    Also, CGC threw in a .5g sample of BD(Blue Dream I assume) since I mentioned a promotion that he was running on another site.  The BD is def. some fire and tastes wonderful.    My favorites: 1. OG Kush  2. Strawberry Diesel / 2. Super Blue Dream (Both are amazing.  I found myself going for the SD more at home since it's more waxy, and the Super Blue Dream when I'm on the go). 4. GirlScout Cookies.  Nothing wrong with this one, it's fire as well.  I just find myself dabbing less of it than the others.     Thanks again CGC!",

Brix can cause a burning sensation in the mouth and on the tongue so visual inspection should always be carried out first.

This one is most important:   5) Check out the vendor forum thread  if none exists  than this vendor is a no-go for me. - see the response in threads from other people - how many responses? - old members or new members? - is he responsive on thread? - Any other threads regarding this vendor?  If new vendor, reviews regarding samples?  ======End of quote========   Found above on deepdotweb a while ago, edited for brevity.

I AM NOT the original creator of this post (original one can be viewed here:  http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=114141.msg775162#msg775162 ). I am merely passing on the information presented within, as I feel there is vital information regarding the preservation of anonymity and privacy. There is a lot of info out there, I am hoping to consolidate it and present it as coherently as possible here. I feel this is the least I can do to support the cause. All credit goes to Fallkniven (I believe)   Tutorial Part 1 - How to install Tails onto a USB drive. -------------------------------------------------------------------  Tails stands for ""The Amnesiac Incognito Live System"". Tails is a live system that aims at preserving your privacy and anonymity. It helps you to use the Internet anonymously almost anywhere you go and on any computer but leave no trace using unless you ask it explicitly. It is a complete operating-system designed to be used from a DVD or a USB stick independently of the computer's original operating system. It is free software and based on Debian GNU/Linux.  Tails comes with several built-in applications pre-configured with security in mind: web browser, instant messaging client, email client, office suite, image and sound editor, etc. Tails relies on the Tor anonymity network to protect your privacy online: the pre-installed software is configured to connect through Tor, and direct (non-anonymous) connections are blocked.  Tails is being constantly updated for security flaws - you WILL need to do this all over again soon to stay safe! This comes from the Tails website - ""It's very important to keep your version of Tails up-to-date, otherwise your system will be vulnerable to numerous security holes. The development team is doing its best to release new versions fixing known security holes on a regular basis.""  You will need 2 x 8GB USB thumb drives (4GB may pass), they are very cheap and available almost everywhere.   *** Update: Meatgrinder has posted steps on how to install Tails to a DVD first, then onto a USB from there. Thanks! *** *** Update #2: Vegeta has offered a way to install Tails to USB with the use of a virtual machine. Thanks! *** *** If any of the links do not work, please PM me and I will update them for you! *** *** All of the following links can and should be downloaded through the Tor network! ***  1 - Download the latest version of the Tails .iso file from here - remember where you save it (latest stable version: 0.19) -  https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html  1a - If you are an advanced user, you can download the cryptographic signature on this same page and then verify the download with the Tails key from here -  https://tails.boum.org/tails-signing.key  2 - Download the latest version of the Linux Universal-USB-Installer from here (latest stable version: 1.9.3.6) -  http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/  3 - Run the newly downloaded Universal-USB-Installer     3a - Read and 'agree to' the disclaimer     3b - Select ""Tails"" from the first drop-down list, it's towards the end of the list (step 1)     3c - Browse to and select the Tails .iso file (step 2)     3d - Select your USB drive letter (format the drive if its not empty already) (step 3)     3e - Click 'Create' button then wait for it to finish. Will be a few minutes at least.  4 - Restart the computer and boot into Tails from the USB drive (see below for details on Booting from a USB drive)  **** (Steps continue in the next post!) ****   Booting from a USB drive: ------------------------------------- If it does not automatically boot to the USB drive, you need to select the boot order, some newer computers will allow you to select which drive to boot to with a small menu, without changing BIOS settings.  You might instead need to edit the BIOS settings, restart your computer, and watch for a message telling you which key to press to enter the BIOS setup. It will usually be one of F1, F2, DEL, ESC or F10. Press this key while your computer is booting to edit your BIOS settings. You need to edit the Boot Order. Depending on your computer you should see an entry for 'removable drive' or 'USB media'. Move this to the top of the list to force the computer to attempt to boot from USB before booting from the hard disk. Save your changes and continue.  Many Flash Drives ship USB-FDD formatted and some systems will not detect or even boot USB-FDD. Most systems can however boot USB-ZIP, and or USB-HDD. If you are having a hard time getting your BIOS to detect your flash drive, you can try to format it as USB-HDD or USB-ZIP using the BOOTICE program (or similar). (Caution - this is a very advanced program! Use with caution - follow links for the latest version)  http://www.pendriveapps.com/bootice-partition-flash-drive-edit-boot-sector/  For more detailed instruction on how to boot from USB you can read  http://pcsupport.about.com/od/tipstricks/ht/bootusbflash.htm  If you have problems accessing the BIOS, read this  http://www.pendrivelinux.com/how-to-access-bios/  I will not accept donations for this tutorial, I offer this only in hope that more people will start using Tor. If you have excess bitcoins you feel like donating to a worthy cause, please send them to Tor or Tails...  https://www.torproject.org/donate/donate.html.en  https://tails.boum.org/contribute/how/donate/#bitcoin  Next up: Installing a Persistent Volume alongside a LiveUSB copy of Tails (this is why you need TWO USB drives)       Re: Security 101- Installing Tails LiveUSB with a Persistent Volume -Full Tutorial « Reply #1 on: October 08, 2013, 05:11:13 pm » Tutorial Part 2 - Setting up a LiveUSB version of Tails, then an Encrypted Persistent Volume. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- You may want to print this text out on paper for easier reference.    *** (Continued from first post!) ***   5 - You should now be presented with a log in prompt for a temporary session administration password - this is reset every time you load Tails, it is optional to enter this, it is used to allow current session access to system functions, if you get any errors about access rights try using an admin password at log in. Also at this point you can optionally select to use a Windows XP camo 'skin' to make Tails look more like XP if you're in a public place for example, this is also optional.   7 - Once Tails is up and running, insert the second USB drive. Click the 'Applications/Accessories' menu, then highlight 'Tails', then click 'Tails USB Installer'.       7a - Click the 1st option ""Clone & Install""           7b - Select your target device from the drop-down menu (your second USB drive!)           7c - Click 'Next', then wait for it to finish (however long to copy about 1gb to a USB drive - usually a few minutes). This will install a new copy of Tails onto your second USB drive, this will be your new proper Tails USB.       8 - Shutdown this session of Tails with the Power Button up in the right-hand corner. Don't forget to take out the FIRST USB you created and BOOT INTO THE NEW SECOND TAILS USB! You can format the first USB drive later on, that copy of tails is no longer required.   9 - Log in to the new Tails USB, once logged in click the 'Applications' menu, then highlight the 'System Tools' sub-menu, then click on ""Configure Persistent Volume"". (The size of the persistent volume is automatically determined by how much left over space is on the USB drive after installing Tails in the previous steps.)       9a - Choose your pass-phrase for the persistent volume - you will need to enter this every time you login to Tails. The persistent volume is an encrypted partition protected by a pass-phrase. Once the persistent volume is created, you can choose to activate it or not each time you start Tails. It is a good place to store sensitive materials. When choosing your pass-phrase remember that short, easily guessed pass-phrases are very easily cracked - it would take one Intel I7 2600k CPU over 200,000,000 YEARS to brute-force crack an AES-256 encrypted 32 random character pass-phrase using lowercase, UPPERCASE, 0-9 & ""$p3c|4!"" characters    )           9b - Click ""Create"" and wait for it to finish.           9c - On completion, a window will popup allowing you to select what Tails will save in the new persistent volume automatically, internet shortcuts, PGP keys, nudie pictures, application settings etc... I recommend selecting everything.       10 - Close and reboot with your modem plugged in and switched on, log back into Tails with your new persistent volume.       11 - Make sure your modem is plugged in and turned ON! Click the 'System' menu, then highlight the 'Preferences' submenu, then click on 'Network Connections'. Now, only YOU know what type of internet connection you pay for, I cannot help you with that! My personal internet connection was amazingly simple to setup (i was quite surprised by its pre-configured setups, it has many different countries options for local telcos pre-installed).       Another note - Tails is PRE-CONFIGURED to go through Tor! It is pre-installed with Vidalia and a Torified browser called 'IceWeasel'. It SHOULD automatically open up when connected to the internet. If not, Use the 'IceWeasel' browser menu shortcut to get onto the Road. Also, this operating system is NOT persistent for security measures, meaning that any changes you make (that are not saved in the persistent volume) will not be saved on restarting Tails! Example is Desktop Backgrounds and general GUI appearance settings (if you manage to get these settings saved and persistent, please let us know!)   Re: Security 101- Installing Tails LiveUSB with a Persistent Volume -Full Tutorial « Reply #2 on: October 08, 2013, 05:16:28 pm » If you have any relevant information pertaining to this topic, feel free to update and improve upon it. This was a response in the original thread (by Meatgrinder) that I feel is worth posting, using the dvd/usb method as an alternative to the 2 usb method of installing Tails.  I did not need 2 USB sticks to make a persistent tails, only 1.  I downloaded the tails ISO, burned it to a blank DVD, left it in the DVD tray and rebooted.  Booted into tails, hit Applications' menu, then highlight 'Tails', then click 'Tails USB Installer' then clone and install (as directed above)  It made the USB stick into a tails bootloader.  Once finished, I plugged the USB into my laptop (the above was done on my gaming/media computer) once booted into tails on my laptop, I went back to ""Applications -> Tails -> Configure persistent volume, chose what I wanted, rebooted and it was done (encryption keys, password hashes etc all saved) tried it on my 3 laptops and my brothers too, all working fine with my tails USB as a persistent volume with files I made as a test. Must have done 30 or so reboots to test it  Re: Security 101- Installing Tails LiveUSB with a Persistent Volume -Full Tutorial « Reply #3 on: October 08, 2013, 05:18:18 pm » Original thread response by Vegeta, installing tails via VM:  If you don't have a DVD drive or burner or DVD's to burn, but have access to a virtual machine, you could also install tails to USB using the virtual machine. It would go something like this: 1) Download latest tails iso from:  https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html 2) Create a linux virtual machine and point the cd/dvd drive to the tails iso file 3) Boot the virtual machine using the tails iso 4) Insert a USB flash drive 5) Connect the USB flash drive to the virtual machine: it will disconnect from your computer and connect to the virtual machine instead 6) Go to Applications -> Tails -> Tails USB Installer 7) Click ""Clone & Install""   Verify that the correct ""Target Device"" is selected by matching the size of the USB Flash Drive you inserted with what is written 9) Click ""Create Live USB"" 10) Click ""Next"" 11) Once installation is completed, click ""OK""  That's it! Now you can shut off the virtual machine, and your USB flash drive can boot tails on any computer capable of booting from USB If you want to configure a persistent volume on a virtual machine, that's also possible! Though I doubt anyone wants to do it once they have the bootable USB with tails on it. If there's any interest, I can post how to do that as well. It's a bit more involved ",

According to the original article the myrcene gets destroyed in the gut and is only effective as absorbed through the lining of the mouth. You might get more out of taking a single bite, chewing it up and leaving it sit in your cheek/gums than just eating the whole thing.  I just haven't had occasion to go by where my oils are but maybe I will wander out and get them tonight... I'm curious if my first impression was legit.  I will be more curious about the mangoes if your herb doesn't normally give a ""couch lock"" effect but you get it from eating mangoes. Seems like the amount you actually get is small compared to sublingual oils though.  Since I have been reading more about receptors and such, I have a way to explain what myrcene is doing. THC is a partial agonist on CB1 receptors. It is ""partial"" so there is a limit to how high you can get with THC when the CB1 receptor is saturated. I'm not sure how myrcene even does it yet (maybe it is an allosteric modulator) but it partially raises the bar and we can get more high.  Synthetic cannibinoids like JWH and stuff can be full agonists on CB1, so there is much more potential for OD and intense trips. The fact that the active compounds in a lot of traditional drugs are only partial agonists leads to them being relatively safe versus new synthetic stuff. Still, it might be worthwhile someday to consider using synthetics carefully and rather than choosing to add myrcene to get more CB1 agonism, add a partial CB1 antagonist to keep the synthetics in check. If we understand better how all this works, we could not only make natural concentrates better but also make synthetics not suck.   I got one of those a while back to check oil temp in a pan. The biggest thing holding me back is having enough herb to experiment without worry of running out.

I'm sure I will have more questions like what griddle to buy and such, so maybe you should make the QWISO tek thread we talked about sometime and let's not go too off topic here. I'm thinking taffy-like would be ideal, but I might want to shoot for more like shatter because I will be adding the step of putting a small amount of lipophilic solvent with the terpenes back with the QWISO which should turn it to taffy.

Made an awesome batch last nite that is currently rocking my nail, along with some honey reclaim dipped in kief...  The 99% is nice because it evaps slightly faster, and maybe less additives, but tbh haven't noticed much diff between it and the 91% with regard to yield, consistency or potency.  That is more about starting material and technique, pretty much.  Someone may correct if wrong, because experience is limited.  Leave iso and cannabis in freezer for 12 hours. Probably won't get much colder... prep work area, nitrile gloves, masks recommended but optional, then work quickly! It is easier as a 2 person thing and one doing timing and support.  Do 20-30 second washes, use only enough iso to cover material. Swirl, don't shake; lately we have been using a french press and pouring the pressed iso thru another coffee filter over a jar. Any more than 3 washes is probably more trouble than it is worth. Laziness has dictated combining washes, turns out ok for home use...most pros do not recommend. If you want the break of pieces shit at room temp, leave your washes uncombined, the 1st one will get you close.  Reduce in H2O bath until about a 1/2 inch is left on bottom of jar. Then pour into clean pyrex for remaining evap. Have a fan blowing over, and if in a hurry, put pyrex pan on a griddle set @ 120 deg F.  Final product outcome is about the purge mostly I think.

If you get too gooey consistency, and darkness, you probably let too much plant matter go thru, or didn't purge well enough.    The final product should be stable enough at room temps to handle without mess, and at least translucent.   ","No problemo, I love doing stuff like this. I wish I had more money and time right now to dive into making my own concentrates but I am about to start a new job and money is tight for a while. I want to know how you get QWISO to come out more like BHO/shatter and not like the crumbly fluff. I think the tek I saw that came out like that suggested 99% ISO and more like 15sec washes with everything in a freezer for a long time, like 2-3 days.I had come across EJmix in my research and it seems very overpriced but that is to be expected with no competition. It doesn't make sense they use all 3 of 400/300/200 so that may be a bit of obfuscation on their part. The number represents an average molecular weight, so you could just use 200 and 400 if you want to end up in the 200-400 range. I'd be happy to formulate a copy of EJmix and open source it if I just had the money and time to play around with it. PEGs are known to decrease permeability with stomach lining (i.e. slow absorption) so similar might happen with inhalation."

One hitter quitter vaping!     ","Quote from: PyroWolf on July 11, 2014, 05:34:22 pmI wonder about the possiblity of vaping myrcene eesential oils mixed with glycerine or pg as an alternative to eating.You mean vaping like on an ecig or putting drops of a dilute myrcene solution on bud and vaping that? Either would work I'd think. I guess interest in terpenes isn't so new and I saw one mention of putting myrcene into an alcohol tincture at a 1:125 ratio. This seems about the same as when I have worked with eucalyptol putting it in a 1% solution of PG then further diluting. The terpenes aren't so soluble in glycerine I bet, at least some of them, so you would have to limit it to maybe 20% or less in a finished blend.I've been kind of busy and have more to reply on, but am still going to be busy a while still too, will try to fit it in though and am still learning a lot. I can report a small test I did and I think it had an effect but I could have been playing tricks on myself.Since I finally got some herb, I built up a little tolerance smoking a few small bowls every night. Two nights back I hadn't smoked all day and had just been on a bike ride, decided to test and then go run errands for an hour. I took two small (~15µl) drops sublingually of blood orange essential oil and one of lime EO, then smoked a small bowl of sativa dominant herb about 10 minutes later. 10-15 minutes after that, I am pulling into the lot at the shops and noticed a bit of brightness in the lights in my rear views and around me as well as a very soft psychedelic vibe that hadn't been occurring when I normally smoked. The enhanced brightness reminded me of taking LSD with vitamin C (something I have not done for ages, nor have I done much trippy stuff either). Like I said, it could have just been placebo, but the visual thing was unexpected. If it was real it will happen again but I won't be able to grab more oils until tomorrow. By the time I was leaving the shops the effect seemed to have subsided and wasn't noticeable smoking a couple hours later.The oils likely had limonene and alpha-terpinol as fairly major components and I read that these have limited agonism on 5HT2A receptors (serotonin related and LSD works on them). I think these and similar terpenes have anxiolytic effects and were said to be stimulating too.The taste of the oils wasn't that bad and I don't think with these there is much concern with toxicity so I wouldn't be worried about upping the dosage 5-fold or even more, but I won't go that far yet. Essential oils are often pretty light and less like olive oil types. They dissolved right into my mouth and the flavor hung around for a few minutes but wasn't so bad I felt I had to take a drink of anything. I could see taste being a concern with higher amounts or other ingredients though.I'm interested in trying to mix some terpenes in with QWISO, but it will take me a while to get to make that. It seems like the ideal end product (maybe just my opinion) would be something more like a cannabis caviar or hash with the terpenated hash oil mixed with ground buds."

Here is my post to you in the 710 thread for others to read the idea: http://forumzxmoorof4ja.onion/index.php?topic=442.msg4174#msg4174I did a little more research and have even more ideas, but I want to put a WARNING to people. There's some debate on if it is safe to ingest essential oils. I think it can or can not be but you just have to look at each individually and not as the whole class of essential oils. A couple drops of citrus oil is probably fine, but a teaspoon of wintergreen oil can kill you. Oils can be GRAS (generally recognized as safe) for foods, but only at some dosages. One would have to look closely at the science behind how the GRAS determination is made if going beyond those limits.I'm treating this like RC's, test small first, know your source, etc. Please ask if you have questions, I will try to help.A lot of scent oils or perfume oils can be diluted in DPG or other shit you do not want to eat. A lot of pure citrus oils you get for adding to foods will actually be ""terpeneless"" (technically, this can be as low as 70% terpenes removed though IIRC). So, point being that you might get an oil that is missing what we are after. I'm going to be using pure, unmodified and organic oils as used in natural perfumery.Again like RC's the taste may be unpleasant. ""Terpy"" is a common taste description and not a positive one. The right oils are meant for perfumes, not eating, so I expect a waxy taste as well.Dermal might be a viable route, but again needs caution. A lot of citrus oils are photosensitizers, meaning you get it on your skin and go in the sun it is going to burn you terribly. Bergamot oil is often sold bergaptene free because it is a terrible photosensitizer but other citrus can be too.I didn't realize last night but 1,8 cineol is also called eucalyptol and I have this pure as well for experimentation. I was confused that something I didn't recognize the name of was supposed to be the main flavor. It might end up being worthwhile to go sort of Dr. Shulgin on this. Myrcene seems key because of how it ""adds to capacity"" of CB1 receptors, but maybe there is something structurally similar that wouldn't be naturally occurring. What personally interest me most right now is the borneol. I'm going to start some tinctures soon."

","I believe that food allergies all have to do with proteins. What gets called allergies to something like cigarette smoke are irritations. So, it seems like your allergies wouldn't be set off by using some type of essential oil. I'd think a drop or two of oil under the tongue would work well for administration. I don't know much about allergies so take that with a grain of salt. I'm new to weed chemistry too but I know a bit about oils and flavor molecules. These are the more interesting parts of an entry on myrcene:Myrcene has a pleasant, sweet, balsamic, plastic odor. [plastic sounds bad but a bunch of other sources don't say that and say a ton of other stuff, very varied]Soluble in alcohol and oils; insoluble in waterAroma characteristics at 10%: terpy, herbaceous, woody with a rosy celery and carrot nuance.Taste characteristics at 5 to 100 ppm: woody, vegetative, citrus fruity with a tropical mango and slight, leafy, minty nuance.Natural occurrence: Reported found in Mircia acris D.C.; in the distillates from leaves of Rhus cotinus and Barosma venustum (52and 43%, respectively); in lemongrass, cypress, artemisia; in the fruits of Phellodendron amurense (92%) and Phellodendron japonicum; in the oils of Picea balsamea, Tsuga canadenis, Abies balsamea, clary sage and others. Also reported in over 200 foods and beverages including citrus peel oils and juices, apricot, sweet and sour cherry, berries, guava, pineapple, carrot, celery, potato, bell pepper, black currants, anise, anise seed, cardamom, cinnamon, cassia, clove, capsicum varities, ginger, mentha oils, mace, parsley, thyme, cheeses, cream, pork, hop oil, beer, white wine, rum, cocoa, coffee, tea, mango, tamarind, coriander, gin, sweet bay, prickly pear, calamus, dill, lovage, caraway, buckwheat, corn, basil, fennel, kiwifruit, rosemary, myrtle berry, turmeric, lemon balm, sage, pimento, angelica oil, Roman and German chamomile oil, eucalyptus and mastic gum oil.I looked into the book they cite in the article and it is interesting about other terpenes and what they are thought to do but there isn't enough detail. Some highlights:Limonene increases blood pressure, alertness, and restlessness. Various Limonene analogs can cue the brain to sexuality, buoyancy or focused attention.Pinene is probably responsible for the smell of true skunk varieties. It is a bronchiodialator and might be responsible for the high coming on quickly. It increases focus, self-satisfaction and energy.Terpineol reduces motility by 45% in rat tests and may be responsible for ""couch lock""Borneol is used as a calming sedative in Chinese medicine and is directed for fatigue, recovery from illness and stress. It gives a camphor smell to Silver Haze varieties and has a calming effect as well as psychedelic aspects.Linalool seems to have strong sedative effects.1,8 Cineol is the main ingredient in eucalyptus oil and has a camphor-minty odor. It increases circulation, relieves pain and has other topical uses. It is considered centering, balancing and stimulating.It seems like if you like what a certain strain does for you, say Silver Haze, you could replicate the effects by dosing any other herb with some Borneol.I have another PDF which has a breakdown of the constituent terpenes in various lime and lemon varieties. Lemons generally have more myrcene vs. limes in an avg 1.6:1.1 ratio. Lemons have more limonene, usually like 70-80 vs about 60 average for limes, although the full range is 38-96% of the oil.alpha-Terpineol seems a bit higher in limes, avg. 0.2 vs 0.3%. There's other similar molecules that might do something, I don't know.Borneol isn't listed but the other book says it is synthesized one way from pinene, so maybe there is a metabolic process. There is generally much more pinene in limes than lemons but Eureka lemons have 11% while Meyer has less than 1%.Cardamom caught my eye as having an array of these terpenes including borneol and pinene. I might try some sort of chew of a mixture of black and green cardamom and see if it does anything. I know that I have some lemon and lime oils too. The bad thing is I have barely been able to smoke the past month and when my order gets here, hopefully in the next few days, I am probably going to get high as fuck off one hit no matter what else I do. Maybe I will try a couple drops of oil on day two and see how it compares."

When I am back I will look harder at actual quantities of these chems we are getting/need.

I still don't get myrcene and haven't been able to find a good scientific paper on how it works exactly. I need to also make sense of what amount of these terpenes we are actually ingesting/smoking.  There's this paper regarding Limonene and 5HT2A receptors [Clearnet warning]:  http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-12052008-124938/unrestricted/umi-umt-1101.pdf  The part on cannabis starts at page 85. The full hemp essential oil (no THC/CBD, in a 1% solution) was able to displace Ketanserin at the 5HT2a receptor to about 20% (so 80% strength relative to other numbers I will give). Then they tested individually: β-caryophyllene, 1,8-cineole, d-limonene, linalool, α-pinene, and α-terpinol and only got displacement of 1,8-cineole (7%), d-limonene (10%), and α-terpinol (18%). They also tested carvone which gave 13% displacement, but then adding some of these terpenes didn't push that number higher.   So, that means that there is competition at the binding site and also that there is some unknown element of the full-spectrum cannabis EO that is causing the synergy to displace up to 80%.   These numbers are made up, but I think the way myrcene will work on CB1 receptors is like THC will displace to 20% then myrcene has allosteric modulation that allows THC to go to 30%. If you are just smoking a bit of herb/QWISO, maybe that isn't even enough to hit 20% and saturate your CB1 at all or for long. If myrcene is doing some other stuff like how it is supposed to be part of ""couch lock"" then that will still work I guess.  Whenever you took those synthetics, I think they are often full  CB1 agonists, so they blew you to 100% and weed would never do that even if you smoked a ton. Also, I read that the psychoactive effects of whatever drug have to do with the combination of different receptors being activated, kind of like different fingers hitting a chord on a piano. Synthetics can do weird stuff like work on opiate receptors, so maybe the ""chord"" of synthetics can just be different than regular old herb even though they are both hitting the same note (CB1).  That type of trip doesn't sound fun to me, so I doubt I will try it unless there was a good way to have CB1 antagonism. Δ9-tetrahydrocannabivarin is a CB2 agonist and CB1 antagonist and there are tiny amounts in herb, but someone would have to make that alone as a synthetic.    Sounds tasty but I doubt it will do much even if you ate your whole batch at once. Flavor is definitely a consideration in all of this. We might want linalool for its sedative and pain-reliving effects, but by itself it might bring the taste of a concentrate to be like smoking lavender flowers, so I might end up adding things just for taste. Ginger is toward the top of my list as being good for flavors paired with citrus and also having important terpenes.  Basically, what I am suggesting someone does (and I will test this as soon as I can) is to add some of these oils to their shatter. By adding the right combinations of things, we can take shatter made with any herb and then make it like shatter from the type of strain we want. One blend could be like a heavy sativa and be great for patients who need to smoke for pain relief, then another could be energizing and uplifting like a sativa.  I've seen some people complain that one dispensary/concentrate maker adds 5% d-limonene (maybe residual from winterizing). Doing this doesn't really seem like a bad thing though. I read that one group performed a test giving a concentrate with no terpenes and then one with 50% terpenes and people preferred the one with the terps.  I finally grabbed my oils and have another report. I started drinking some mixed drinks around 10 last night and took 3x drops of a 1% solution of 1,8-cineol (eucalyptol) along with 5x drops of lemon essential oil (probably equivalent to the zest of multiple lemons, both of these ~20μL drops). I mixed up the last few grams of a sativa and an indica-dominant and smoked a bowl of that about 5 minutes later.  I didn't notice the same light sparkly-ness of lights as with the last test, but then I was in a different environment at home versus in the car. I chilled out for about an hour watching some TV and just felt good, but I am not sure what the terpenes were doing if anything. I wasn't that drunk, but about an hour later I decided to take more oils and I am doing this by drying out my mouth between my teeth and bottom lip then dropping the oils there. On round 2, I fumbled one drop I didn't count and remember feeling a bit extra intoxicated, more than I thought I should be at this point, when handling my droppers.  I took 4 more drops of lemon EO (~20 μL) and 1 each lime EO and blood orange EO (~15μL each) and then smoked another bowl. It seems like the effects of these terpenes lasts about 1-2 hours, because they seem to taper off even when I smoked more 3-4+ hours in.  I don't have a great description of how I felt after round 2, but I am fairly convinced the terps were doing something and whatever that was I liked it. I got the urge to smoke a 3rd bowl at about another 30 minutes in, but my tolerance is such that I don't feel anywhere near this fucked up when I usually smoke a few bowls. Being drunk probably throws this off some though. At least I stopped being dumb and finally grabbed my oils so I can test more, but I am going to be away for next week.  Besides knowing that the 1,8-cineol is pure I don't really know the full composition of these citrus oils. Limonene is certainly a major component, but it could be a blend of isomers (not pure d-limonene) and then there is a collection of stuff like terpineols and maybe even a touch of the other major terps like myrcene and linalool. If limonene is supposed to be energizing and an anti-depressant, I could believe it was having such effects on me because I definitely felt good.","First night:  effect was negligible, if at all.  I used a fresh red mango, ripe but not overly so.  I ate some and i also chewed some and left it in my mouth for as long as I could tolerate.  It was actually quite hard for me to hold onto it for more than 30-60sec before the urge to swallow happened.  I have no patience and saliva was building up at an alarming rate .I had some QWISO from my leftover AfrikanSun bud sample.  Not saying anything about his more than generous sample.   It does have THC and a nice light spicy taste .  I'm a nightly vaper and have recently started concentrates in a small way that I hit on occassionally during the day.  My tolerance is there, but I don't know how it is in comparison to others.   I saw no real perceivable difference pre mango and post mango taken at different intervals.  It's a very light strain and the QWISO i made is also a light hitter.I'm going to let these ripen up more since I read that myrcene is higher when very ripe.   In a couple of days I'll try again.And I know what you are saying about synthetics OD.  I once tried JWH (can't remember, was one of the 2 most common at the time, legal then too) and I had no tolerance to THC whatsoever.  Talk about OD feeling.  Near green out, pale to yellow skin, major paranoia about death, time dialation.  Luckily I was able to get my head about and ride out the 2-3 hours before it subsided.  I threw that shit away afterwards.  Only real stuff for me now.;Really couldn't absorb all of that, but sounds like some strange science.  I plan on trying this with my Rangpur limes - once they're finished - hopefully the tequila won't counteract the effects of the lime rinds. If you rest the shaved rinds in sugar, while still fresh and moist, and then cook them slowly in fry pan, they turn into ""candied rinds"", sometimes called ""zest"", as in lemon zest. These work wonderfully to garnish a pie, especially like a key lime or lemon pie, and are quite tasty to munch. But I'm hoping they can also be used to top off a perfect Margarita. I'll try to remember to report back in the fall, they should be ready by then. I think the CD13 may be the right pairing, but I'm out of stock so maybe hard to tell for sure..."

I'm thinking taffy-like would be ideal, but I might want to shoot for more like shatter because I will be adding the step of putting a small amount of lipophilic solvent with the terpenes back with the QWISO which should turn it to taffy.

When all moisture is gone but the surface still looks kinda oily, scrape everything into a pile on parchment, it should be kinda flakey...clean razor blades are key...Then fold parchment and smush oil together, set on warm surface using fingers to smooth the melting pile into as flat as possible, then open parchment like rorschack (sp?) test and set out on griddle open faced with quarters on corners for ~ 30 min.

I wish I had more money and time right now to dive into making my own concentrates but I am about to start a new job and money is tight for a while. I want to know how you get QWISO to come out more like BHO/shatter and not like the crumbly fluff. I think the tek I saw that came out like that suggested 99% ISO and more like 15sec washes with everything in a freezer for a long time, like 2-3 days.  I had come across EJmix in my research and it seems very overpriced but that is to be expected with no competition. It doesn't make sense they use all 3 of 400/300/200 so that may be a bit of obfuscation on their part. The number represents an average molecular weight, so you could just use 200 and 400 if you want to end up in the 200-400 range. I'd be happy to formulate a copy of EJmix and open source it if I just had the money and time to play around with it. PEGs are known to decrease permeability with stomach lining (i.e. slow absorption) so similar might happen with inhalation.  Myrcene doesn't interest me personally that much and I don't have it on hand so it will be lower priority to me. I'm such a lightweight that ""raising the ceiling"" on how much my CB1 receptors can take might not matter. For heavier concentrate users it might be more interesting. Along with a-terpineol, myrcene is also suspected to be guilty of causing ""couch lock"", so not sure this is always desirable.  At some point, I will have a response for AngelEyes on linalool and go over some more stuff on what each of these terpenes do.","Thanks so much for the research, experimentation, and knowledge drop, starpower. Your posts are always informative and thought provoking.

Either would work I'd think. I guess interest in terpenes isn't so new and I saw one mention of putting myrcene into an alcohol tincture at a 1:125 ratio. This seems about the same as when I have worked with eucalyptol putting it in a 1% solution of PG then further diluting. The terpenes aren't so soluble in glycerine I bet, at least some of them, so you would have to limit it to maybe 20% or less in a finished blend.  I've been kind of busy and have more to reply on, but am still going to be busy a while still too, will try to fit it in though and am still learning a lot. I can report a small test I did and I think it had an effect but I could have been playing tricks on myself.  Since I finally got some herb, I built up a little tolerance smoking a few small bowls every night. Two nights back I hadn't smoked all day and had just been on a bike ride, decided to test and then go run errands for an hour. I took two small (~15µl) drops sublingually of blood orange essential oil and one of lime EO, then smoked a small bowl of sativa dominant herb about 10 minutes later.   10-15 minutes after that, I am pulling into the lot at the shops and noticed a bit of brightness in the lights in my rear views and around me as well as a very soft psychedelic vibe that hadn't been occurring when I normally smoked. The enhanced brightness reminded me of taking LSD with vitamin C (something I have not done for ages, nor have I done much trippy stuff either). Like I said, it could have just been placebo, but the visual thing was unexpected. If it was real it will happen again but I won't be able to grab more oils until tomorrow. By the time I was leaving the shops the effect seemed to have subsided and wasn't noticeable smoking a couple hours later.  The oils likely had limonene and alpha-terpinol as fairly major components and I read that these have limited agonism on 5HT2A receptors (serotonin related and LSD works on them). I think these and similar terpenes have anxiolytic effects and were said to be stimulating too.  The taste of the oils wasn't that bad and I don't think with these there is much concern with toxicity so I wouldn't be worried about upping the dosage 5-fold or even more, but I won't go that far yet. Essential oils are often pretty light and less like olive oil types. They dissolved right into my mouth and the flavor hung around for a few minutes but wasn't so bad I felt I had to take a drink of anything. I could see taste being a concern with higher amounts or other ingredients though.  I'm interested in trying to mix some terpenes in with QWISO, but it will take me a while to get to make that. It seems like the ideal end product (maybe just my opinion) would be something more like a cannabis caviar or hash with the terpenated hash oil mixed with ground buds.",I wonder about the possiblity of vaping myrcene eesential oils mixed with glycerine or pg as an alternative to eating.

What gets called allergies to something like cigarette smoke are irritations. So, it seems like your allergies wouldn't be set off by using some type of essential oil. I'd think a drop or two of oil under the tongue would work well for administration. I don't know much about allergies so take that with a grain of salt. I'm new to weed chemistry too but I know a bit about oils and flavor molecules. These are the more interesting parts of an entry on myrcene:  Myrcene has a pleasant, sweet, balsamic, plastic odor. [plastic sounds bad but a bunch of other sources don't say that and say a ton of other stuff, very varied]  Soluble in alcohol and oils; insoluble in water  Aroma characteristics at 10%: terpy, herbaceous, woody with a rosy celery and carrot nuance.  Taste characteristics at 5 to 100 ppm: woody, vegetative, citrus fruity with a tropical mango and slight, leafy, minty nuance.  Natural occurrence: Reported found in Mircia acris D.C.; in the distillates from leaves of Rhus cotinus and Barosma venustum (52and 43%, respectively); in lemongrass, cypress, artemisia; in the fruits of Phellodendron amurense (92%) and Phellodendron japonicum; in the oils of Picea balsamea, Tsuga canadenis, Abies balsamea, clary sage and others. Also reported in over 200 foods and beverages including citrus peel oils and juices, apricot, sweet and sour cherry, berries, guava, pineapple, carrot, celery, potato, bell pepper, black currants, anise, anise seed, cardamom, cinnamon, cassia, clove, capsicum varities, ginger, mentha oils, mace, parsley, thyme, cheeses, cream, pork, hop oil, beer, white wine, rum, cocoa, coffee, tea, mango, tamarind, coriander, gin, sweet bay, prickly pear, calamus, dill, lovage, caraway, buckwheat, corn, basil, fennel, kiwifruit, rosemary, myrtle berry, turmeric, lemon balm, sage, pimento, angelica oil, Roman and German chamomile oil, eucalyptus and mastic gum oil.  I looked into the book they cite in the article and it is interesting about other terpenes and what they are thought to do but there isn't enough detail. Some highlights:  Limonene increases blood pressure, alertness, and restlessness. Various Limonene analogs can cue the brain to sexuality, buoyancy or focused attention.  Pinene is probably responsible for the smell of true skunk varieties. It is a bronchiodialator and might be responsible for the high coming on quickly. It increases focus, self-satisfaction and energy.  Terpineol reduces motility by 45% in rat tests and may be responsible for ""couch lock""  Borneol is used as a calming sedative in Chinese medicine and is directed for fatigue, recovery from illness and stress. It gives a camphor smell to Silver Haze varieties and has a calming effect as well as psychedelic aspects.  Linalool seems to have strong sedative effects.  1,8 Cineol is the main ingredient in eucalyptus oil and has a camphor-minty odor. It increases circulation, relieves pain and has other topical uses. It is considered centering, balancing and stimulating.  It seems like if you like what a certain strain does for you, say Silver Haze, you could replicate the effects by dosing any other herb with some Borneol.  I have another PDF which has a breakdown of the constituent terpenes in various lime and lemon varieties. Lemons generally have more myrcene vs. limes in an avg 1.6:1.1 ratio. Lemons have more limonene, usually like 70-80 vs about 60 average for limes, although the full range is 38-96% of the oil.  alpha-Terpineol seems a bit higher in limes, avg. 0.2 vs 0.3%. There's other similar molecules that might do something, I don't know.  Borneol isn't listed but the other book says it is synthesized one way from pinene, so maybe there is a metabolic process. There is generally much more pinene in limes than lemons but Eureka lemons have 11% while Meyer has less than 1%.  Cardamom caught my eye as having an array of these terpenes including borneol and pinene. I might try some sort of chew of a mixture of black and green cardamom and see if it does anything. I know that I have some lemon and lime oils too. The bad thing is I have barely been able to smoke the past month and when my order gets here, hopefully in the next few days, I am probably going to get high as fuck off one hit no matter what else I do. Maybe I will try a couple drops of oil on day two and see how it compares.    ",

Bitcoin is already, in itself, completely trustless. There is no central authority that governs over the issuance of Bitcoin or the regulation of its supply. It is scarce; bitcoins cannot be created out of thin air, unlike the fiat currencies we are currently forced by law to use. Even transactions with Bitcoin are trustless. Once a payment is sent, it cannot be retrieved in any way. Therefore, it cannot be double spent. The transaction is confirmed by randomly chosen miners in a matter of minutes. There is no middle man, no bank or credit card company, that you have to put your faith in. The topic of Bitcoins impact on the structure and operation of government has been widely discussed in the Bitcoin community. The main source of government power is its monopoly on money. With the sole authority to issue money create arbitrarily and infinitely, governments can pay for anything they want. They can wage endless wars over politics and natural resources, or they can fund massive welfare states to keep the citizens complacent and subservient. Bitcoin can change all that. By decentralizing the money supply, governments lose their monopoly control over it. Furthermore, the pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin makes it difficult to track, essentially rendering the governments power of compulsory taxation moot. Consequently, governments would rely on voluntary donations to continue operations, meaning that they actually have to provide value to society. This change in the operation of governments would make them completely voluntary, which many argue would make them completely obsolete. But Bitcoin cannot fully decentralize all aspects of society, however. Even if it can render violent governments impotent, Bitcoin does not do very much in terms of creating decentralized social structures outside of the realm of money. Here is where Ethereum will fill the gap. Ethereum is not a crypto-currency, it is not even a monetary system. It isnt a website, or any kind of social network. Ethereum is a platform. That is all Ethereum is. It is a platform based on smart contracts that allow for the funding and implementation of any type of project. The only limitations are those limits on the imaginations of the people using Ethereum. Simply put, Ethereum is a decentralized development platform that provides a trustless system of contracts and project implementation. This distributed development platform operates on Ether, the built in unit of payment in the Ethereum network. The Ethers could, of course, end up being a currency. However, the potentialities of Ethereum are so grand that the Ether will likely serve as a means of digitally signing contracts and verifying escrow transactions that release other currencies, like Bitcoin, into the possession of the person who has completed the contracted job. The main building block of Ethereum is the smart contract, which is a decentralized, trustless contract that exists within the Ethereum network. They are verified by using Ethers to confirm transactions and are limited only by what the developers using this platform can imagine, as was mentioned before. And the things that have so far been imagined are simply stunning! Here is a list of a few things that are possible within the Ethereum network that are listed on the platforms official website: Create a currency and issue shares. Contracts, law, and escrow. Financial instruments and derivatives. Decentralized organizations (DAOs). Decentralized voting. Decentralized data storage. These are only a few basic things that are listed on Ethereums website. The possibilities are literally endless. The concept is so simple yet elegant; a decentralized system of contracts that can be used to create anything that is desired. However, the development process is extremely complex. This project is the cutting edge of decentralization technology, far outweighing that of the various crypto-currencies, despite their constant growth and improvement. It is essentially impossible to cover all of the things that can be done on Ethereum, because literally anything that is contract-based can be done. So let us imagine what the operation of a city would look like on the Ethereum network. Imagine that a neighborhood or city has a social contract outlined in a digital format on Ethereum. The contract would guarantee things that normal governments provide today, such as water and electricity. However, this social contract would be completely voluntary, there would be no forced taxation of violent enforcement of the rules, or lawsif they could be called laws under this system. An individual moving into the area would consent to this social contract by sending an Ether to an address that is owned by a company or agency responsible for supplying and maintaining the utility in question, whether it be water, power, sewer, telephone, etc. This transaction would set another transaction in motion, in which the person who has newly confirmed his or her consent to the social contract puts the necessary payment into an escrow service, which would of course operate on Ethereum. The company would then turn on the water, power, etc. in this persons house. Once the utility has been turned on, the person confirms the transaction by approving the release of his funds from the escrow account. The process repeats in the next payment cycle. If the utility company turns on the power but the resident does not release the money from escrow, the company simply turns the power off. There is no force involved, everyone is responsible for their actions. Failure to comply with the explicitly agreed upon contract results in a revocation of the services provided under the contract. This scenario seems like a much more peaceful method of conducting society indeed! Ethereum is still in the development stages at this point, so there are no empirical facts currently available about the efficacy of this system. So all we can do is speculate and theorize, which is what we have been doing above. However, if Ethereum is successfully implemented, the situation described in the previous paragraph could indeed become a reality, along with an infinite set of other social and economic organizations. If it can be imagined, and built based on a system of decentralized contractswhich everything can be, theoreticallythen it can be done on Ethereum. The second part will discuss in potentials, Btc-Etherum and implementations.",

The ability to preload withdrawal addresses would be a great improvement.  Vendors ideally should be using a different address for each withdrawal (better anonymity).  The way the vendor panel is set up now, it's pretty difficult to achieve this short of watching for every order that finalizes and quickly changing the withdrawal address before the next order finalizes.  In practical terms, it's not really feasible.  The ability for vendors to upload a batch of withdrawal addresses seems like it should be a high priority item.  Just my 2 cents.  TBC made this suggestion a while ago.  Are these feature requests just waiting their turn?  Any idea when we might see them?  Are they still on the table.   jack   very difficult and time, it's usually recommended to seems like it would improve On the withdrawal addresses preload option    ill greatWe're supportive of anything that can streamline the process   streamline  ","Quote from: TheBestCannabis on May 04, 2014, 07:30:52 pmWhile I'm here, another feature I think would be incredibly helpful is being able to provide a list of bitcoin addresses to automatically withdraw to, instead of just one.

A law professor and a professor of criminal science argue, in a paper released online, that by reducing physical contact between drug dealersparticularly between dealers and their suppliersthe Silk Roads bustling Web-based narcotics trade may have prevented bloodshed that would have occurred in the street-level illegal drug market.  The Silk Road, after all, became a bustling online drug bazaar by giving users a new way to deal in contraband anonymously. On the site and dozens of copycats that followed its takedown by law enforcement in October, users physical locations were obscured by tools like bitcoin and the anonymity software Tor. Those crypto protections are designed to prevent anyoneincluding cops and competitorsfrom knowing where users are. According to University of Lausanne criminologist David Decary-Hetu and University of Manchester law professor Judith Aldridge, that layer of anonymity made technical know-how and online customer service, not a propensity for violence, the barrier to entry for dealers on the Silk Road.  This new breed of drug dealer is likely to be relatively free from the violence typically associated with traditional drug markets, reads the paper, the title of which calls Silk Road a paradigm-shifting criminal innovation. Whereas violence [in the traditional drug trade] was commonly used to gain market share, protect turfs and resolve conflicts , the virtual location and anonymity that the cryptomarket provides reduces or eliminates the need  or even the ability  to resort to violence.  In the drugs cryptomarket era, the paper adds, having good customer service and writing skillsmay be more important than muscles and face-to-face connections. In the drugs cryptomarket era, having good customer service and writing skills may be more important than muscles and face-to-face connections.  Aldridge and Decary-Hetus study, still being reviewed for publication by a journal they declined to name, doesnt offer crime statistics to back up that argument. Instead, it uses slightly convoluted logic based on assumptions about the source of violence in the drug world. The Silk Roads role in reducing bloodshed, they say, is a very clear inference from an analysis of the size of transactions made on the market. Using a custom web crawler, they scraped Silk Road in September of 2013just before its shutdown by the FBIto collect a snapshot of all feedback and review data from the sites vendor profiles. Those posts provided a catalog of past deals on the site, including their frequency and size. They found that the high average price of those deals, along with other clues, implies a surprisingly large number of Silk Road buyers were not consumers, but dealers buying wholesale.  Thats a different take than previous studies, which have described Silk Road as an eBay for drugs. Instead, Aldridge and Decary-Hetu say their data shows a vast portion of the Silk Roads sales were business-to-business. That finding moves the markets role farther up the drug market supply chain than was previously thought, they argue, placing it closer to the cartel-controlled drug producers behind much of the trades violence. And since the study argues the traders on both sides of a Silk Road deal were often drug dealers, the researchers claim Silk Roads business-to-business deals mean twice as many opportunities for violence were prevented.  All of that assumes, without much hard evidence, that transactions between drug dealers and their suppliers lead to dangerous conflicts more often than transactions between dealers and their customers. But Aldridge argues you dont have to swallow that premise to take her larger point about how the Silk Road model reduces violence: Virtual drug deals dont allow for physical attacks. People who dont meet face to face cant hit each other or shoot each other, she says.  According to the studys measurements, the top 20 percent of Silk Road deals were for more than $1,000$1,475 for cannabis and $3,494 for ecstasy, for instance. Those amounts, which Decary-Hetu and Aldridge compared with previous studies on real-world drug dealers, sound like far larger purchases than those intended for personal consumption. And in terms of revenue, those high-priced deals were much more important to the sites sellers livelihoods, bringing in between 31 percent and 45 percent of their total revenue versus just 3 percent or 4 percent for deals in the cheapest 20 percent. The presence of products like precursor ingredient for synthesizing drugs and lab notes also implies that drug dealers, not just consumers, were shopping on the site.  The study also notes that the Silk Road trade focused far more on less addictive and harmful drugs than might have been previously assumed. Drugs typically associated with drug dependence, harmful use and chaotic lifestyles (heroin, methamphetamine and crack cocaine) do not much appear on Silk Road, and generate very little revenue, the study reads. It explains that skew by pointing to the waiting period between a Silk Road drug buy and the products arrival, vacuum-sealed, in the mail. The site may therefore have suited purchases by recreational users with the resources and time to place orders and wait for deliveries; dependent users with chaotic lifestyles, in contrast, were likely to have had neither.  If the Silk Road did in fact reduce violence, thats in part by design. The sites founder, who called himself the Dread Pirate Roberts and is alleged to be 30-year-old Ross Ulbricht, wrote that his creation was intended to enable non-violent, small-time dealers and to take power away from bloody cartels.  For the first time I saw the drug cartels and the dealers, and every person in the whole damn supply chain in a different light, he wrote on the sites now-defunct user forums in 2012. Some, especially the cartels, are basically a de facto violent power hungry state, and surely would love nothing more than to take control of a national government, but your average joe pot dealer, who wouldnt hurt a fly, that guy became my heroIt wasnt long, maybe a year or two after this realization that the pieces started coming together for the Silk Road.  The notion of the Silk Road as a peace-loving innovation, of course, is tarnished by prosecutors accusations that Ulbricht paid would-be assassins to kill six people, including a blackmailer and an employee he worried might act as an informant.  But Aldridge counters that those murder-for-hire attempts took place outside the Silk Roads market, and have little to do with its interactions. Our argument about situational violence doesnt mean people cant be violent in other aspects of their lives, she says. They can engage in domestic violence or fight when theyre drunk, but none of those things are facilitated by a crypto market.  She also notes that despite the prosecutions claims, the killings Ulbricht allegedly commissioned dont appear to have occurred; they may well have all been law enforcement stings or scams by con artists posing as assassins. The same anonymous, bitcoin-based transactions that worked so well for facilitating drug deals, Aldridge argues, havent turned out to be as convenient a system for paid murder. We havent seen any, to our knowledge, murder-for-hires happening on crypto markets, she says. In fact, it may be much harder by virtue of the markets anonymity.  Even if they do reward nonviolence, Aldridge and Decary-Hetu admit the Silk Road and the sites its inspired still account for just a tiny portion of the overall drug trade. Zeta drug cartel enforcers wont need to trade their AK-47s and briefcases of cash for Tor and bitcoin just yet.",

En quelques mots, ce paiement mutlisignature est plus sûr car: -il vous permet de faire intervenir un tiers (ici le market) en cas de litige entre vous et le vendeur, -il vous garanti que si demain le market fermait (ce qui n'arrivera pas!)les admins ne pourraient pas disparaître en emportant vos bitcoins. -pour les VENDEURS, il permet de faire intervenir un tiers  (ici le market) en cas de litige entre vous et un client.   Comment:  -en créant une adresse à partir de 3 clé publiques (la vôtre, celle du marchand et celle du market) pour vos  transactions. Pour valider une transaction sur l'adresse ainsi créée 2 des 3 participants doivent entrer leur clé privée. Donc: -en cas de litige entre client et vendeur, (l'un des deux refusant d'entrer sa clé privée) le market peut arbitrer et décider de valider ou pas le transfert de BTCs, -en cas de fermeture du market, les admins n'ayant qu'1 des 3 clés, il ne peuvent accéder à vos BTCs, puisqu'il en faut obligatoirement 2.   1-Rendez vous sur bitaddress.org:   https://www.bitaddress.org/  (!!!CLEARNET!!!)  a/ Déconnectez vous d'internet pour plus de sécurité (la page est faite pour fonctionner hors ligne)  b/ Bougez la souris dans tous les sens de la manière la plus aléatoire possible pour rendre l'opération plus sûre, jusqu'à voir une nouvelle page apparaître avec deux QR codes (SHARE/SECRET) au dessous desquelles  apparaissent deux chaînes de caractères relativement longues.

I know most people think that it builds appetite, but some, myself included, experience the opposite, and it can actually be used for effective weight management.

But really I'm just in it for the recreational angle, and I always try to avoid that whole refer madness thing, and it is healthy to weigh less.

I knew I had read that something in herb was anorectic (makes us not hungry versus how typically we get munchies)QuoteHumulene is a sesquiterpene also known as α-humulene and αcaryophyllene; an isomer of βcaryophyllene. Humulene is found in hops, cannabis sativa strains, and Vietnamese coriander, among others. Humulene gives beer its hoppy aroma. It is anti-tumor, anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anorectic (suppresses appetite). It has commonly been blended with βcaryophyllene and used as a major remedy for inflammation, and is well known to Chinese medicine."

I know many daily users who hit the bong all day, every day and are useless pieces of crap, whose goal for the week is to make it to the weekend and get stoned with their friends and talk about how stoned they were that time.  But we also have people who truly understand the neurochemistry behind your brain and how cannabis interacts with it and use it responsbly. Cannabis can make you more creative, it can enhance ""right brain thinking"" in people who otherwise are more logical thinkers. I use it when I'm ""stuck"" and I need to think outside the box.   But when taken in excessive amounts, this effect becomes diminished and you become a vegetable stuck on the couch. Just like dopamine, a chemical in your brain highly associated with addiction that is stimulated in massive amounts with drugs like cocaine, cannabis delivers high doses of endocannabinoids that are higher than what the body produces naturally and it is not crazy to think the same type of desensitisation occurs when you flood your brain with these chemicals just like when your brain is flooded with dopamine from other narcotics.  It's like taking pharmaceutical drugs, more is NOT better. Just my opinion.",

Its a short period of time that is very important to your future.  You have your whole life afterwards to get high.  I grow pot and smoke it pretty regularly, so I'm no teatotaller or propagandist obviously.  I'm also quite a bit older than you are and I can say there were times in my life that I wish someone had told me to lay off the weed around this or that important event.  Part of it depends on how ambitious you are I guess, but if you do have goals that require academic credentials then its best to learn early that there are times to party and there are times you should not.  A bit of self-discipline in a matter like this can translate into a much happier future IMO.",

I will say it is a little weird to me that you ""can't determine whether or not you are losing intelligence."" Really? You can't determine? I would be more worried about what habits you are getting into in your daily life that make it impossible to determine if you are becoming dumb as a rock.   For me, if I'm high, it can be difficult to focus on reading long passages as easily, I get distracted easier, and my motivation gets a little tricky - other than that, smoking a joint isn't going to drop your IQ any significant amount.   Do you find it difficult to write? To express yourself? What problems are you having that make you question your intelligence? Maybe it would be helpful to take an IQ test both now and again in several months and compare results.   Have you ever heard of Double-N-Back? It is a brain game involving both audio and visual stimulation that is extremely challenging.   You are still the same person essentially, if you can write an essay, you can write an essay. ","I have a lot of big events coming up, primarily SAT's and the college essay. I've been smoking a lot recently, and I can't determine whether or not I'm losing intelligence. I've never really been too concerned with the effects of weed because everyone said nothing is permanent, but strictly speaking from temporary side effects, how difficult will it be for someone to work with the same brain function before they started smoking? Not sure if this is a dumb question, but I don't want to fuck up my college essay.         thanks"

As far as I know, there is not actual menthol in cannabis or only in very small amounts (menthol is a taste modifier at amounts it is not noticeable on its own though). Both 1,8-cineol and borneol (another important terpenoid not listed in the open source test results) are cooling agents (weaker than menthol), so maybe they can be confused for menthol. Borneol easily oxidizes to camphor and there are some reports of psychoactivity from smoking camphor.  The test results I see on Afgoo vary but mostly show low-moderate levels of humulene (not active AFAIK) and beta-caryophyllene (AKA BCP, a CB2 agonist like CBD), then a few strains had low levels of myrcene/linalool and one had terpinolene.  The Jack Herer I looked at was very high in total terpenoids, especially linalool and limonene with similar low BCP/humulene like Afgoo. Durban poison is very similar but just has less linalool.  The original article on terpenes I had found said that borneol is notable in Silver Haze so maybe the coolness like menthol is coming from the Haze heritage through JH.  edit: I was wrong about humulene not doing anything. I knew I had read that something in herb was anorectic (makes us not hungry versus how typically we get munchies)  ","Quote from: starpower on July 31, 2014, 08:54:31 pmI'm not sure what strains have more 1,8-cineol. Anyone remember smoking some herb that tastes cool like menthol or like eucalyptus? Various lemon or citrus strains will have either limonene or the terpineol relatives. These are also often energizing or stimulant and anti-depressants. Pinene is probably what gives ""skunky"" smells to some strains.Inhalation of 1,8-cineol has been shown to increase cerebral blood flow and cortical activity like the ginkolides terpenoids in Ginko Biloba. AChE inhibition is one aspect I will be paying attention to in our terpenes thread: http://forumzxmoorof4ja.onion/index.php?topic=440...had some righteouus JahGoo in the spring that was super methol donkey punch with a eucalyptusey kick in the ass!;Humulene is a sesquiterpene also known as α-humulene and αcaryophyllene; an isomer of βcaryophyllene. Humulene is found in hops, cannabis sativa strains, and Vietnamese coriander, among others. Humulene gives beer its hoppy aroma. It is anti-tumor, anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anorectic (suppresses appetite). It has commonly been blended with βcaryophyllene and used as a major remedy for inflammation, and is well known to Chinese medicine."

Pulegone is also mentioned in one book (Russo's) with the note ""Memory booster?"" but anyhows this is what AChE is: People who have Alzheimer's have a deficit of ACh (acetylcholine). ACh activity is increased when AChE (acetylcholinesterase) is inhibited.  Tacrine (Cognex) is an AChE inhibitor drug that has been given to Alzheimer's patients and has been shown to block THC-induced memory loss behaviour in rats. How strong of AChE inhibition we get from these terpenes compared to tacrine is an open question but I do see references to try to keep digging deeper.

","In my opinion, cannabis usage and effects/benefits are experienced on what's called a bell shaped curve.I know many daily users who hit the bong all day, every day and are useless pieces of crap, whose goal for the week is to make it to the weekend and get stoned with their friends and talk about how stoned they were that time.But we also have people who truly understand the neurochemistry behind your brain and how cannabis interacts with it and use it responsbly. Cannabis can make you more creative, it can enhance ""right brain thinking"" in people who otherwise are more logical thinkers. I use it when I'm ""stuck"" and I need to think outside the box. But when taken in excessive amounts, this effect becomes diminished and you become a vegetable stuck on the couch. Just like dopamine, a chemical in your brain highly associated with addiction that is stimulated in massive amounts with drugs like cocaine, cannabis delivers high doses of endocannabinoids that are higher than what the body produces naturally and it is not crazy to think the same type of desensitisation occurs when you flood your brain with these chemicals just like when your brain is flooded with dopamine from other narcotics.It's like taking pharmaceutical drugs, more is NOT better. Just my opinion."

Some would say more left-brain focused, that it unlocks creativity while making it harder to focus on details, many ways to express it. But, it really just changes your perspective on things, and it's not always easy to describe.  It commonly makes people ""think"" that they're more intelligent. Some might call that a negative, a form of self-deception, some a positive because you are what you think, so if you think you're smarter, then, just maybe, you actually are smarter. If you're motivated to do something, because you feel smarter, something that you may not have done without having that sense, then we start to see how Ganja users rationalize their own experiences. Well, anyway, that's how I do it.   However, taking an SAT demands a certain type of brain function that is not typically enhanced with the drug, and the opposite is often the case. Advise against using any drugs while studying or taking the SAT. This coming from someone who has taken many a test, high as a kite, and knows damn well that it did not help.       ",

In simpler terms it is turning money which might be risky to spend into money that you can spend with little to no legal risk.  NB: Simply tumbling your BTC does not constitute laundering as it does not provide you with a reasonable explanation regarding the origins of the funds.  When looking at complex systems it is useful to break them down into their component parts. In the case of money laundering we can break it down into three steps;      * Placement - Where the funds are transformed into something we can easily manipulate.     * Layering - Where the funds are manipulated in such a way that it is difficult, or impossible, to determine their origins.     * Integration - Where the funds are integrated back into a income stream looking like legitimate income.  Let's look at each of these steps more in depth.  Placement =========== Whether we are starting with cold hard cash or some other kind of funds, we need to transform this into something which we can manipulate in the way of our choosing. Traditionally this meant getting cash into the banking system. In modern times this can mean transforming the funds into digital currencies such as Bitcoin or a derivative thereof.  Layering =========== Once money is in a form that we can manipulate we will then have to manipulate them in a way such that their origins are obscured. This traditionally meant international bank transfers through countries with strong bank secrecy laws. With digital currencies this step does not need to involve banks and can be done quicker.  Integration ============ Now that the origins of the funds have been obscured they need to be integrated back into your life in a way that masks them as legitimate income. Traditionally this meant owning a cash intensive business, and slowly infiltrating the money into the legitimate cash stream by making fake sales. It should be noted that this particular method includes all three steps in one (It does however rely upon you owning and operating a profitable, or close-to, cash heavy business).  Why do we want to launder the money we have? ============================================= Funds gained through illicit means can not easily be used to purchase the more substantial assets one might need in life (e.g. real estate, cars, investments, etc.), this is where money laundering comes in. The end-result of properly laundered money is a legal income stream that you can declare to the government and pay taxes on. The latter part being the most important one. Remember; they got Al Capone on Tax Evasion.  The reason for making it an income stream is a matter of camouflage. You want to blend in to the masses, and not raise any suspicion. Think of how most people acquire and use money these days: They are paid a salary for a job and pay for any expenses with a credit-/debit card and/or with a national bank account.  Anonymous debit cards from offshore banks are only good for paying for operational expenses related to your illicit activity, they should not be your only source of funds as it does not offer an explanation regarding the source of the aforementioned funds.  Always remember that money laundering is all about camouflaging yourself financially to avoid suspicion and to 'throw of the scent'. It should be part of a larger OPSEC regiment, but that topic is beyond the scope of this introduction. ",

He is back on track and producing the same badass product in the pictures and we are set to be caught up 100% by this Friday(6/5), at which point I will be ACTIVE again.  I have given all current processing buyers 2 options, Refund or Wait.  Some people have decided to stain my name on the forums due receiving these simple options. You can see I have feedback on the market, of which people think are padded without reasonable proof. These shills are wrong.     i wanted to try his wax too, but its almost impossible for me to just buy an oz from a guy without sampling it first and when the vendor has very little feedback as well. ive seen him say on the forums he doesnt deal with smaller amoutns than an oz because he ""likes to make money and is looking for the other businessmen who also want to make money"". also said something like ""realy businessmen dont read some feedback and feel confidnece, they communicate with the vendor and when they are dealt with professionally THEN they feel confident enough to order. this is not word for word at all, but ive had to look in other places than BCB due to these reasons. which is too bad because i am a businessman and a good customer, but over the darknet we all have reason to be suspicious of everyone, regardless of their ability to communicate.",

For those of you who dont know me, I have been vending since about a month before SR1 had its doors shut. I have also vended on Sheep, BMR, and am currently vending on Evolution and Agora.   My prices are the same everywhere you go, so market doesnt matter. I appeal to those in need.   I am currently waiting for the staff to waive my vendor bond so I can get my store set up, so if any of you wish to purchase for me, LINE UP. =)  I offer Ounces and UPPPP. I encourage bulk buying as there are great deals to be had. I also offer incentive for my trusting buyers who want to be awesome an FE upon ordering. I give 2-3 grams extra PER OUNCE FE'd.  I have 2-3 day ship times anywhere in the US, AMAZING 100% smell proof stealth(as reported from other buyers), and my customer service is one of the best.  ******UPDATES****** I am currently running off of 100Lbs of 50/50 Trim/Nugs, containing about 8 different strains. I will update with strain availability once we get all of our stuff sorted and packed up into freezers. We just picked this stuff up about 3 days ago so it takes some time to sort.  When I get my store up and post the picture for my product, it is the ONLY strain I currently have available for production, so pleaseee dont ask about strains. But hey....Its OG Kush, so who can complain, right?  Email is in Sig.  --BCB",

GPA doesn't give you the option to choose 4096 when creating a key which is why I had to use Kleopatra. CR only finally accepted the key I made in 4096 then I deleted the other two.

Very good points.  I did forget about the escaping reality portion that could be considered an addiction.  If I were to have any leanings towards dependency I would think that would be mine.  I'm sure most understand that - stress, work, family, bills, etc.    Don't get me wrong, I can put away alcohol to the point I put known alcoholics to shame (which I'm not proud of, I'm an expensive date:)).  My metabolism seemingly processes alcohol faster and I'm also experienced enough to know what I drink now might not hit for 30 minutes and tend to pace.  That being said, I do not depend on or crave it and can (and do) drop it without thinking about it for a long while.    I also found cannabis later in life ( I'm not old unless you ask a teenager) and enjoy it as an escape.  I'm sure my liver is thanking me.  It also helps with all the nitpicky health issues I or the ball and chain has - good benefit.  Long story short, I think the portrayal of pothead being a thieving no-good looking for his next fix is a bunch of bullshit.  You can do pot and be a productive member of society - many here probably prove that every day.   I've seen more people fuck up lives with alcohol, benzos, or opiates than pot.

When I was younger and in college, I literally smoked my way out of a degree.  This was not a marijuana problem, it was a psychological problem.  In many cases, there is always an underlying problem when someone uses drugs as an escape.  That is what should be focused upon, and not the drug itself.  Yes, if you have psychological problems and turn to drugs to escape from them, then you should probably stop using them and figure out how to solve the problem.  But, I don't think the drug is to blame.

If your method of abstaining is to have it 'out of sight, out of mind' and that works for you I say more power to you.  We all have a vice or three and if that is your way to control it I'm happy for you having found the way.  Somehow I didn't inherit some of my family's addictive properties so I do not have that issue.  However, I've seen drugs (painkillers), alcohol, and delusions of grandeur either destroy lives or close members of my family.    I've seen my nieces and nephew's toys stolen and pawned by their own dad, I've seen another family member throw a multi-million dollar business away and lose his wife and kids.   Any uncontrolled drug use can turn out bad.  Heck, even controlled drug usage can cause problems - antidepressants or others.

They pull in any and every debt, favor and loan they can. They smoke pipe resin. They look in the crevices of their stash container or the cracks in the floorboards for just a small, tiny, bit of bud...I've lost count of the times I've seen this. Cokeheads and crackheads aren't as bad as this. I know because I've BEEN one of the above, and I wasn't as frantic as potheads are. It's like they're on heroin withdrawal. I've seen one guy take his $3000 laptop and pawn it at a store for $50 so he could get a quarter ounce of schwag, because he was so impatient to get stoned. I never saw a cokehead do that; even they have enough patience to sell their stuff for something close to market value!I've seen people steal from friends and family for it. I've seen perfectly normal people break into cars to steal things for it. I've seen one particularly bad case of it where the guy resorted to snatching people's iPhones out of their hands and running off to pawn it before it's reported stolen.;So: this is why I think cannabis is dangerous... and why it absolutely has to be controlled.

But what's it actually good for? Inaccurate, uncited memes claiming its efficacy in treating everything from cancer to epilepsy travel on social media like wildfire, but what does the science actually say?   Marijuana, or Cannabis sativa, is an annual plant originally from Central Asia that has been used for medicinal purposes for at least 3,000 years. The biologically active compounds found in the plant are called cannabinoids; at least 66 have been identified so far. These interact with two types of receptor; CB1 receptors which are found predominantly on cells in the brain and spinal cord, and CB2 which are found in various immune cells. The most potent cannabinoid is thought to be delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).  It is thought that cannabinoids may be useful in treating a variety of ailments, namely glaucoma, pain, nausea, muscle spasms and loss of appetite. It is also being investigated in cancer patients as a way to alleviate the side effects of cancer therapy, but some laboratory tests are also investigating antitumor properties.  Stimulating Appetite  Cannabinoids such as THC have been shown in numerous animal studies to increase food consumption and some human trials have also shown positive results. For example, a study comparing THC with a placebo in cancer patients found that those taking THC had a better appetite and sense of taste, and although they didnt consume more calories they felt more relaxed and had a better quality of sleep compared to the placebo group.  Another study investigating the FDA-approved synthetic cannabinoid (THC) drug dronabinol in HIV/AIDS patients presenting weight loss found that those taking THC ate more than controls and stopped losing weight. However, in a study comparing dronabinol with a standard drug (megestrol) in cancer patients presenting loss of appetite, researchers found that dronabinol was not as effective as megestrol in increasing appetite or weight gain.  No surprises here, but a study in healthy people found that those inhaling marijuana consumed more calories (had the munchies), especially from fatty and sugary snacks, than those inhaling a placebo.  How does it stimulate appetite? The CB1 receptor is active in numerous areas of the body that are known to stimulate eating behavior, such as the hypothalamus and limbic forebrain, and also certain areas in the stomach and intestine. THC can exert effects by mimicking endogenous substances (called endocannabinoids) that are naturally found in the body. Nausea and Vomiting  There have been numerous studies investigating the ability of cannabinoids to reduce and nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy. A 2001 systematic review of 30 studies involving synthetic cannabinoids (dronabinol, nabilone or levonantradol) compared with a placebo or an active control (a non-cannabinoid drug) found that the cannabinoids were more effective than the active control or the placebo at reducing vomiting and nausea. Furthermore, patients demonstrated a preference for the cannabinoid drugs over the placebo and the active control drugs, and they presented limited side-effects.  How do they work? The endocannabinoid system (the name for the group of molecules and receptors such as CB1 and CB2 that are collectively involved in a variety of physiological processes and mediating the psychoactive effects of marijuana) is key to modulating numerous systems such as reward pathways, pain perception and emesis (vomiting). Areas of the brain involved in chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting are higher cortical and limbic regions that can influence the stimulation or suppression of nausea and vomiting. CB1 receptors are found in high quantities in these areas, and drugs such as nabilone can agonize these receptors. Pain Relief  While neither nabilone nor dronabinol are FDA approved for pain management, a few studies have shown that they may be beneficial. For example, a small 2010 study carried out by McGill University Health Centre investigated 21 adults with post-traumatic or postsurgical neuropathic pain. Participants were randomly assigned to receive cannabis at 4 potencies (0%, 2.5%, 6% or 9.4% THC) which was smoked at home three times a day. All participants used all four potencies, which were rotated throughout the duration of the study. Participants recorded pain intensity and also mood, sleep and quality of life. They found that cannabis smoked at a concentration of 9.4% THC moderately reduced pain and improved sleep, with few side-effects. Larger studies are needed to verify these results.  A 2007 study carried out by researchers from the University of California at San Francisco looked at HIV patients with peripheral neuropathy and found that a significantly higher number of patients receiving the treatment (smoking marijuana) experienced a reduction in pain compared with the placebo group. Glaucoma  Glaucoma is a condition caused by an increase in pressure within the eye which can lead to blindness if left untreated. Cannabinoids effectively lower intraocular pressure (IOP), likely by increasing ocular blood flow through their vasorelaxant properties, and there have been a few studies since the 1970s investigating cannabis as a possible treatment for glaucoma. For example, an early and small trial in 1971 demonstrated that smoking marijuana reduced IOP but the effects only lasted 3-4 hours, limiting its usefulness when taken in this manner. However, studies have shown that while marijuana may temporarily reduce IOP, it also lowers blood pressure throughout the body, canceling out the beneficial effects.  A 1999 report by the Institute of Medicine concluded that despite the observed reduction in IOP by cannabinoids and marijuana, the effect is too short lived and required too high doses, and there are too many side effects to recommend lifelong use in the treatment of glaucoma. The potential harmful effects of chronic marijuana smoking outweigh its modest benefits in the treatment of glaucoma. Epilepsy  Epilepsy, which is a neurological disorder characterized by episodic seizures, affects around 2.3 million Americans, almost half of whom live with uncontrolled seizures. The use of marijuana to treat epilepsy has a complex history. Some animal studies have demonstrated that THC can control seizures that are unresponsive to other treatments, whereas a few have also shown that it might trigger seizures. So far, there exists only one published human clinical trial demonstrating the effectiveness of marijuana in the treatment of epilepsy which was conducted in 1980 and involved only 16 participants. Half of the individuals receiving cannabidiol remained almost free of convulsions throughout the study, and a further 3 demonstrated some improvement in their condition. Only one of the placebo recipients improved.  Recent preclinical studies carried out by the University of Reading identified a particular marijuana compound that showed great promise in the treatment of epilepsy as it helped to reduce convulsions and was well-tolerated. To take this forward, a British pharmaceutical company called GW Pharmaceuticals announced last September that it would be initiating a Phase 1 Clinical Trial of a non-psychoactive cannabinoid called GWP42006 in the treatment of epilepsy.   Anecdotal evidence for the success of marijuana in controlling seizures from epilepsy sufferers also spurred a senator in the U.S. to put forward a bill allowing people in South Carolina to use CBD oil to treat epilepsy, which was passed into law two days ago.  Muscle Tension and Spasm  It has been suggested that marijuana may be able to help control both muscle stiffness and spasms, but the results are conflicting.  In 2001, a large placebo-controlled trial was initiated in Britain which set out to investigate marijuana in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. 630 people with different forms of MS were enrolled, and although the study found that oral derivatives or marijuana did not provide objective improvements in spasticity (as measured by physicians), the patients reported feeling improvements in spasticity and pain. Based on these results, a further study was initiated to investigate whether dronabinol slows the progression of MS. The study, which was published in Lancet Neurology, found that dronabinol did not positively affect (slow) disease progression.  However, a 2013 study led by the same researcher investigating 400 individuals with MS found that muscle stiffness improved by almost twofold in the cannabis group when compared with the placebo group.  Therefore, some inconsistencies remain in data and medics are currently unsure as to whether the benefits outweigh the side effects. Autoimmune Diseases  A very recent study, published in The Journal of Biological Chemistry, has suggested that THC can suppress the immune system of rodents through epigenetic modifications (changes in gene expression that do not involve changes in DNA sequence), raising the possibility that it could be used to treat autoimmune diseases such as arthritis and multiple sclerosis. However, it is certainly early days yet and further investigation is warranted since the study left many questions unanswered, for example how long the effects of THC last for. Furthermore, their results also hinted that the infamous BRCA2 gene may be suppressed by THC. This tumor suppressor gene produces a protein involved in DNA repair, so we certainly don't want to be suppressing its activities as this can lead to cancer.  Antitumor Properties  There have been numerous laboratory and animal-based studies that have shown antitumor properties of cannabis, or more specifically THC. In particular, several studies have shown that cannabinoid administration can prevent the growth of cultured brain cancer cells and tumor xenografts (human tumor tissue transplanted into animals) in rodents, including gliomas (brain cancers derived from glial cells). One study investigating the most aggressive glioma, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), which is also notoriously resistant to anticancer therapies, found that THC in combination with the conventional GBM therapy (temozolomide) exerted strong antitumor activities in mice with glioma xenografts. They also found that administering submaximal doses of THC and cannabidiol, another cannabinoid, together with temozolomide reduced the growth of both temozolomide-sensitive and temozolomide-resistant tumors in animal models.  Although no human studies (in the medical field) have yet been carried out on cancer and cannabis, the promising results gathered so far from cell culture and animal studies prompted researchers to initiate the first human trials using cannabis to treat GBM. The small pilot study will involve a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled phase with 20 patients investigating cannabinoids in combination with temozolomide. Results have not yet been published.  A 2007 Harvard study investigating THC also found that non-toxic doses of the cannabinoid inhibited the growth and spread of lung tumor cell lines and also reduced tumor size in mice with human lung cancer xenografts when compared with a control group. However, the researchers cautioned that they did not know the exact mechanisms behind this and that further investigation is needed since some studies have actually shown that THC can stimulate some cancers. For example, a 2000 study published in the Journal of Immunology found that THC promoted lung tumor growth in mice by impeding the bodys antitumor system.   There are many websites which state that cannabis cures cancer- it doesnt. As demonstrated, cannabis may have many potential applications in medicine, and laboratory and animal studies have yielded some promising results with regards to cancer. But cancer is not one single disease, and saying it is a cure is wrong, especially due to conflicting results and the fact that studies so far regarding antitumor properties have not been conducted in humans.   If you'd like to find out more, check out this great review of cannabis studies conducted for a variety of medical conditions.  Marijuana is a fascinating plant, with a wide range of uses. Its use in medicine is currently being researched all around the world, and there are many situations in which it can be helpful. However, anything being touted as a ""miracle"" cure for anything should be treated with suspicion. There is no such thing as a miracle, and everything that has an effect also has side-effects. The positives and negatives to every treatment must be carefully weighed up. It is also important to not overstate the importance of laboratory and animal models - while useful and scientifically interesting, they do not prove anything with regards to human treatment. Long term, human trials are required before we can state definitively how useful medical marijuana is in treating each of these illnesses.

I wasn't in a super rush so this wasn't a huge deal to me since i had also assumed that would happen going into the transaction (reddit effect).    Product was well packaged and was not crushed in the slightest.  Any other delays were out of his control.  Stealth 5+/5 - a bit humorous because of the content.  Very good stealth.   Customs form was filled out properly, proper postage, packaged appropriately in accordance to what was listed on the customs form.  Multiple visual and smell barriers.  No smells until the last bag.  I think Domo's stealth should be a minimum for all vendors    communication 4.9/5  - only marked down because of not getting directly notified of initial shipping delay.  Before and after this Domopost was very available and usually answered within minutes for my multiples of contacts.  This is totally understandable and I almost don't feel right for marking him off for this.. but I have to  price 10/5 - $130 shipped to me?  Holy fuck.  Too bad this deal is not going on any more.  Even at his new price of $160 (i think), this is still an awesome value for a very good smoke.  I do believe this is my best deal I've done on the markets.  Product 5/5  - I ordered OG Shark.  Googling brings up spotty results as to the origins, but supposedly it is OG Kush and White Shark hybrid.  Domo, correct or confirm if you can.      visual - great bag appeal.  No shake, no seeds, only nugs.  Most of the nugs were about the same size.  appropriate stems for the nugs.  looks well trimmed.   Lighter green with some darker green mixed in.  Close inspection shows lots of dark orangish brown pistils and a good coating of trichomes.  This looks like fairly high grade bud.        weight - right on, tad over      smell -  typical semi fruity smell with a bit of musk/earth.  I feel it is more of a citrus/orange smell than a berry type smell.  I don't know what it is about weed but my mouth waters just smelling the buds      misc - curing and trim job seem good.  It didn't seem sticky until i started breaking it up to load it into the vape.  With even a light load it tended to progressively get tighter draws as it all pulled together..  So much so that near the end it was like sucking on a thick milkshake where you have to fight against the back pressure/vacuum.  I didn't hit it hard at all either time so I don't know the full effects yet.  It had a nice massaging head feeling that seemed to be progressing to body buzz or numbness.  I need to hit it harder to make sure    If heavier hits do what I think it will with this one I can say I think I'll love this strain.      taste - I only vape.   First hits are almost orange or other light citrus with decent sweetness.  Online reviews say berry, but I don't get that.  it progresses to an earthy, almost spicy, somewhat peppery taste when it is almost spent.  The vapor towards this end seems a little dry but not harsh.  Very solid and pleasing flavor.  What's funny is while partaking I don't really smell it that much.  Wifey came home about 30 minutes after I did it and gave me a look because the whole house smelled like it..the skunky pot smell.  She had a kid or two with her and was surprised they didn't say anything .  Whoops, I guess a fan, open window, air freshener and doing it up in our bedroom wasn't enough.    My next session was in the master bath with all the fans and windows open.  That solved the problem.

Communication 5/5: He communicated everything and made sure all of my needs were met. He even sent me a PGP encrypted message with the tracking number! A+ (although this only because I FE'D)  Product 5/5: Considering the price I paid, I was expected some twigs and a bunch of seeds mixed with some shake. What I got was better than most of the stuff I can buy at a premium price in my area. Stellar!

I thought perhaps all those sleepless nights trying to catch up on orders perhaps we have made a mistake or so in packaging, stealth or any of the procedures needed to get your product there safety but thank goodness it was just the holidays slowing things down! Glad you found the stealth humorous as we have put a lot of thought into in and then some    stay tuned for our next release! should be soon  domo",

The buds are quite dense and have lots of red and orange hues. This weed has a nice strong indica stone that i find very relaxing and carefree. high quality, well cured, bargain.   Unknown hybrid - Some very nice Canadian mids. Its cheaper than the bubba and isnt quite as well presented (some big stalks and leaf), but for the price i really have no complaints. The weed is earthy, spicy and minty when smoking. I find that in a vaporizer this stuff is  much tastier, with lovely floral and orange flavours. Im actually very impressed with this mid-grade weed as the effect is a nice head high along with a relaxing body buzz that takes away all the aches and pains.  stealth and delivery were top notch, domopost really is a great vendor!

The shipping time was very fast, though I tend to have a quick postal service most of the time. I felt totally comfortable placing an international order after seeing communication from AfriKanSun plus all of the positive feedback, and I don't feel let down. The stealth wasn't as extreme as some people like it to be, but with the price we're paying, and the fact that it always makes it, I think it's about where it needs to be. The buds were very compressed, but it's not an issue as long as you have a grinder. Pay attention stoners: YOU WILL NEED A GRINDER. It makes it a little harder to judge the amount you're grinding up, but I'm just nitpicking here. The compression seems to benefit the stealth anyway.The weed itself, well I'm almost too stoned to type this, and I smoke daily. It's got a more pronounced Indica effect than I'm used to, but I normally only ever smoke Sativas. It feels like being wrapped up in a very comfortable blanket. The Sativa effect is still noticeable though as I seem to have developed an understanding of Jazz music. Given that you can get 10g of this for slightly less than what it costs for 3.5g of ""high grade"", this is a great option. "

I was a bit sceptical at first, 'why would he send we free smoke all that way?' , 'Maybe it's just a way of getting free bumps on a forum?'.  I have to say, I was delighted and excited when an envelope appeared from South Africa to me in the UK, just over a week later.  AfriKanSun achieved what my deadbeat South African father has failed to do for 20 yeards - a crisp envelope, with a South African stamp on it, and noting but love inside.For starters, the sample that was included is an ammount of weed that will last me a few days, plus free king size rizla. The weed inside is, by appearance, what we in the UK would call block weed; dry, light in colour and almost odourless. Simple outdoor weed with only a couple of seeds. I rolled it up as it crumbled easily into the rizla, a little tobacco and I was good to go. Let me tell you this: There is no weed I would rather have been smoking on this fine sunny day in my hammock. Despite my expectations it was smooth and tasted far stronger and more pleasant than it smelled. Sure there's crazy strong week out there that'll make you cough like a mofo and collaps into a sticky mess; but why drink strong spirits on a sunny afternoon when you can sip lager?This was a pleasant body high and buzz. Perfect to chill out and take a load off - and cheap!I reccomend AfrikanSun and 'Special One', as a toker, of 17 years. Peace bredren.RoscoeMG"

I ordered 5g of the ama special and asked for a sample of the cheaper weed. What I actually recieved was 2g ama and a 2g sample. However I contacted our friend and he said this was a mistake and that he would send out the 5g again, so all's good.Both strains look and smell pretty much the same, although when I came to de-seed the weed I noticed that there were far fewer sticks and seed in the ama special. The weed itself is dry and crumbles easily. A slight problem with the extreme vacuum packing of these weed packets is that the seeds were mostly crushed, so it was a bit of a pain picking out all the little bits.I've so far only tried the ama special, which is a nice smoke. AfriKanSun doesn't lie about the quality of his weed. It does have seeds and sticks but it's a nice smooth smoke.My main issue with this vendor is actually the stealth. I've only ever ordered from within the UK before and the stealth has always been far better. The weed was vacuum packed, but only once, where I would expect double for international shipping. Although the contents of the package were pretty undistinguishable from outside, the return address was pretty suspicious (I'm not going to say why here) for an international packet. It probably didn't help that my two strains came in two different packets, both identical but with different return names and adresses, on the same day. I hope my mailman wasn't paying too much attention! Although my weed arrived ok this time I'd be wary if ordering too frequently if it doesn't improve. Perhaps the stealth for larger packets is better.Overall though AfriKanSun seems like a genuine, friendly guy, and his weed is easily the quality he says it is."

Here is everything we know about CBD. Hope this can help.  So, there are a bunch of strains that have been bred to maximize on CBD. To name a few: Harlequin, Omrita RX, Cannatonic, Charlotte's Web. You can try looking for those on the various DNM.  Now, the definitions for legal hemp are based off of %THC. Anything less than 3% THC is considered hemp (this law was passed for the purposes of handling textiles, clothes, etc,) Since CBD is not THC, it can still be sold under the guise of ""hemp."" Many companies are doing this. Look at PharmaJane's products, or Medical Marijuana, Inc.'s High CBD Dixie caps and Dixie cream. It is legal to purchase these products and have them shipped to your home.  For those of you that live in medical/recreational states, you can purchase a CBD tincture and add it to your cannabis a few drops at a time, so as to have the desirable effects of THC and CBD.  We hope this helps you guys!  P.S. If you stumble upon any CBD flowers or trim, we would appreciate it if you let us know! We would love to use it to make CBD extracts! If somebody networks us to a CBD plant source, we will give them such ridiculous hook-ups that it's not funny.",

Anyhow, the problem right now is that to get reliable high-CBD marijuana, one really needs to travel to a weed-legal state like Cali, Colorado or Washington.  The problem is that all of the seed-strains that are available to grow will not reliably produce high CBD levels and without lab testing, there's no way to know other than being your own personal test subject.  For example, Cannatonic is a strain people have been recommending (along with Charlotte's Web and a bunch of others).  The thing is, if you read about Cannatonic, its not terribly high in CBD.  Its higher than your average marijauan strain but that's not saying much.  However, there is a daughter phenotype of Cannatonic called ACDC that is clone-only and has lab-tested incredibly high CBD levels.  ACDC's THC:CBD ratio is 1:20, meaning it has twenty times the CBD as THC.  This likely means the plant will have very few psychoactive effects if any and will be very effective for delivery of CBD.  However, once you take seeds from an ACDC plant you have no way of knowing if the progeny will have a high CBD count.  Cannatonic, its parent, has a 1:1 THC to CBD ratio.  Since ACDC is clone only one would have to travel to a dispensary that has the clones and ship it back home to grow, which is of course illegal, not to mention ACDC clones are scooped up fast and almost impossible to find.  So for now, your best bet if you really need CBD is to find ACDC buds, tinctures, etc., or to find lab-produced tinctures, etc. such as those discussed by @BHOgart.  Just be careful that you are working with a reputable firm because the race for CBD products has left a lot of room for fucktard scammers to prey on desperate people.  These site look interesting for marijuana tinctures, but I can't recommend or dis-recommend them, one has to do their own research in this very young field (clearnet warning):             http://medithrive.com/tinctures1.html            http://synergycbd.com/tincture/  Also, its important to know that seizures and many other illnesses have been treated with regular cannabis for many decades.  The mechanism of action for these effects is not well understood, so its not clear whether its CBD, THC, or some other marijuana compound(s), or many of them in conjunction, that will be effective for particular people with particular maladies.

We've all been there. Perhaps you smoked too much, too fast. Perhaps you mixed two potent strains together and they didn't interact well. Regardless of the cause, even the most experienced connoisseur will likely experience this condition at some point in their lives. The last time I personally experienced cannabis anxiety, I was at a party and smoked a bunch of different strains and got higher than I'd ever expected. It was too much for me to handle, and I got anxious, and I had to leave the party. I spent the next six hours listening to music in my car while waiting for the high to end. Not a fun experience.  Louis CK tells a pretty accurate (and hilarious) story of one of his own pot paranoia experiences. You should hear it. It's a riot. But watch it  after you finish reading this, otherwise you'll forget to finish reading. Because, let's face it, you're probably stoned right now. (That's okay, so am I.)  So anyway... Cannabis anxiety sucks. But what can we do? Well, the easiest solution is to smoke in moderation, and to be mindful of the set and setting in which you smoke. (""Set and setting"" refers to your emotional and psychological state of mind as well as the environment in which you smoke, both of which can have a profound impact on the experience.) But if you're already experiencing cannabis anxiety, it's not always easy to change the set and setting and break yourself out of the ""bad trip.""  Fortunately, research has found a solution to the problem of cannabis anxiety. According to a study by Ethan Russo, MD, published in the British Journal of Pharmacology, as well as numerous follow-up articles by numerous sources (see ""Sources"" below), the answer is most likely sitting in your kitchen as you read this. (Hint: It's pepper.)  That's right, ladies and gentlemen! Black pepper! We stuffed it in Pharaohs' noses during mummification in ancient Egypt. We cooked with it as far back as 2 BCE. It was one of the most prized trade goods in early Asia. Some cultures used it as money. We even used it as medicine, including in eye drops in the 5th century. Today, we grind it up and put it on our food, and sell it in little plastic shakers at grocery stores. It is in every home and restaurant. And now, it can cure your pot paranoia.  Now, don't go snorting pepper. That won't go well for you. In fact, simply the smell of crushed black peppercorns is all it takes to ease the anxiety. If you have a handkerchief or kleenex, just crush some pepper into a little pile in the center, pull up the corners, then twist it so that the pepper is in a little pocket at the bottom. You can put a rubber band around it to keep the pocket in place. It looks kind of like one of those handkerchief ghosts you used to make as a kid. (I'm not the only one, right?) If the kleenex is too thick, you might be able to remove a thin layer, if it's more than one-ply. As long as you can smell the pepper through the tissue, you're good.  If you're too stoned to make a pepper pocket, you can simply grind up some pepper and  carefully smell it. Don't smell too hard or you'll get pepper in your nose. Just be calm, step up to the pepper, breathe in half-way, then put your nose about an inch from the pepper and SLOWLY inhale the scent. You've got this. I believe in you.  The science behind why this works is intricate and fascinating, but you don't have to understand  why something works to know that it works. But if you do want to know, I've linked to some very informative articles at the bottom of this post!  Congratulations! You are now prepared to face and defeat your pot paranoia! Just enjoy the relaxing aroma of peppercorns.  And don't forget to watch that Louis CK video! The link is below. (You're welcome.)

Voters two years ago rejected a marijuana legalization measure that received little funding and ran almost no advertising of any kind.  In contrast, New Approach Oregon's campaign director, Liz Kaufman, said the $2.3 million is a ""base television buy"" and could be added to in coming weeks.  Purchase reports disclosed by two Portland TV stations, KGW and KATU, show the campaign has reserved $750,000 in ad time between Sept. 22 and the Nov. 4 election.  The campaign also released a commercial featuring Richard Harris, the retired head of the state's addictions and mental health division, praising the measure.  Kaufman said the ad will also run on TV, perhaps within days.  Harris, who was also executive director of Portland's Central City Concern, before retiring in 2008, praises the measure for providing money for drug treatment and prevention, which he said is now ""overwhelmingly underfunded"" in the state.  He also called marijuana is a ""relatively benign drug"" and that its illegality is fueling violence and the drug cartels.  New Approach Oregon has not yet revealed how it will pay for the ads.  So far, though it has had a well-funded effort that relies heavily on out-of-state money.  Much of the group's money has come from a political fund connected to New York-based Drug Policy Alliance, which says it wants to change the law so that ""people are no longer punished for what they put into their own bodies but only for crimes committed against others.""",

The information of all the transactions are kept in the Bitcoin block which is computed by and kept by the miners.  This is why rewards are given to miners, as they are doing all the number crunching.  The rewards also promote more miners so there is a spread and no-single miner with less than around 40% of the mining power can cheat the numbers.  So now we have the first part: Bitcoin Blockchain - The Ledger  The next important thing is how are funds moved around in the Bitcoin Blockchain, if Bitcoins are not moved in and out of the wallet?  In a simplified manner, Blockchain is actually a big list of addresses and the funds in them.  When funds are spent into an address, the Blockchain will write that the funds were put into the address or moved out of an address.  On to the second part: Funding an Address  How does the Blockchain know who owns the address?  In order to understand this, it is important to first understand what an address is.  An address consists of 3 parts (based on version 1 of Bitcoin Addresses).  1. Private key 2. Public Key : a hash of the private key 3. Address : a hash of the public key with a checksum, then convert to base58  (source:  https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Technical_background_of_Bitcoin_addresses)  Now that we know all 3 are actually related and unique to each other, we can see as we go from 1 to 3, there is a layer of security between each.  You can use a private key to recreate the public key and address, but not the other way around.  Now that we know what the keys are, we look at how it's used:  In the third part: Spending 1. Address: once a fund has been spent into the address, we now have a balance in the address 2. Public Key: the public key is exposed to create a transaction when preparing to send 3. Private Key: now to complete the transaction, the private key is used to sign and identify the rights to send the transaction created with the public key  As can be seen, the private key identifies the right to spend from an address on the Blockchain, as the Private Key is used to derive the Public Key and Address.  Therefore, the private key just shows permission to move funds in the Blockchain for a specific address.  Finally, we have the last part: The Wallet  If a wallet does not hold Bitcoins, what does it hold?  A wallet is more similar in analogy to an account book that holds your account #s and passwords.  What the native Bitcoin-QT wallet client actually does is:  1. Hold private key/public key/addresses to be used for moving funds in the Blockchain 2. Connects and sends the transaction instructions accordingly 3. Scan and keeps records of your transactions from the Blockchain  Some wallets don't even do #3 as they use online sources for information about your account (as having a wallet with the full Blockchain can take up quite a bit of space and continue to grow - since it is a copy of all transactions in the ledger).  Technically, you would not even need a wallet to access your funds.  You just need the private key for your address.  Cold storage is when funds are sent to an address where the private keys are not online or accessible by computer.  This could be as simple as printing your public and private key onto a piece of paper, to saving it in a text file in your USB and sticking it in your drawer.  Without the private key, the address can not be accessed.

I've come to like (love?) concentrates (thanks JackBlue).  I've been using that Kiss cart in my mech mod and the hits are great as long as I follow Tech2014's cleaning/fill instructions.  It is VERY stealthy and strong.  A few small hits and I get medicated quickly.  Since the hits are so small the smell is virtually non-existent.  I ask yield because I've already burned thru my 1st gram and I'm gonna attempt my own batch.  I assume yield is dependent upon THC % and 'fudge factor'?  Let me know if I'm thinking right?!  I'm using round numbers to make the calculations easier. Start with 28g of weed (bud, not trim) with about 20% THC.  In a perfect world and 100% extraction I'd get 28 x 20% = 5g extract.   Assume I have 70% efficiency extracting.  30% plant matter or just left behind.  5g x 70% = 3.5g extract.  So for every ounce of weed I can get an 1/8 oz of concentrate? Trim would go lower because of THC % would be lower.  Am I thinking along the right track?  Also, When using ISO, is a purge necessary or is that just a step to shorten time?  In my experience in non-weed playing around, ISO evaporates completely without residue. ",

The analogy with beer and liquor makes sense, but here is my idea: I read that purging qwiso and/or heat can remove a lot of the terpenes we were talking about. I think you can make BHO/qwiso or whatever and that is like the vodka in a mixed drink. You then add the appropriate mix of terpenes back in, so any mundane concentrate takes on the characteristics of the skunk or silver haze (or all of them for possibly mega-good stuff). That is like the bitters or whatever. Then personally, I like the act of toking, so maybe you make a hash with some pollen/shake. It will dilute it down to more reasonable levels like a fruit juice.",

Then I got a taste of potent herb and changed my mind on that too.The analogy with beer and liquor makes sense, but here is my idea: I read that purging qwiso and/or heat can remove a lot of the terpenes we were talking about. I think you can make BHO/qwiso or whatever and that is like the vodka in a mixed drink. You then add the appropriate mix of terpenes back in, so any mundane concentrate takes on the characteristics of the skunk or silver haze (or all of them for possibly mega-good stuff). That is like the bitters or whatever. Then personally, I like the act of toking, so maybe you make a hash with some pollen/shake. It will dilute it down to more reasonable levels like a fruit juice."

Nice thing about them stoner holidays, its their flexibility!  FYI: a corndog, or what i think of as a corndog, is when you take a stickier oil or wax, put that on your dab tool and then stick something less sticky to that, then dab. For example I took a tiny bit of sticky shatter on my tool, stuck some qwiso (quick wash iso hash) which is less so, and heated up the nail and hit that shit.  That particular dab hit back. The DG shatter is no joke!  One thing thing that initially intimidated was the terminology of the various products. Wax, shatter, budder, bho, qwiso, are all basically cannabis oils that have been manipulated by various methods to get a desired outcome.  I don't drink and not particularly fond of liquor analogies but this one should work - think of smoking/vaping flowers like having beer, you can sip on that for a few minutes and get gradually buzzed. after a few more beers, drunk. Doing a dab like taking a shot of whiskey. You get there a whole lot quicker! After a few shots, drunk.  Same result.  The other thing I like is not consuming all that extraneous plant matter, which can get..heavy, yanno?  That is the main difference. It is all cannabis. And yes if you do dabs all day every day you will get burnt out quickly. You also will not get much else done. Same as if you pulled tubes all day or whatever. As adults we should be able to medicate responsibly and still take care of our own shit, yanno?   I have been a burnout by most peoples standards since I started getting high 20 million years ago.. Always could smoke even the biggest pothead under the table, even before I knew how to get mmj in my shit state. And when I got to CR, with all this plentiful beautiful cannabis and derivatives, learned to make my own concentrates, I went a lil coockoo for coco puffs..still like that pretty much...but I have learned some effective strategies to manage my tolerance and still get plennnnyy high from smoking a couple righteous bong hits or passing a doob with a friend.  Best wishes this holiday season and hope your order shows up yesterday!! ",

(BruceBanner),Cannabis Road Discussion/General Discussion,"TheDude, I believe you are correct.  Total THC consumption would be a product of how ingested, how many times ingested, and concentration.  It probably is a simple math problem until you add the human factor.  Is my toke the same as your toke?  Is my tolerance the same as your tolerance?  Ultimately the amounts go in are all up to the user.  My typical experience is just like what you describe.  I take a few hits to get to a quick 'up' baseline and then wait to see where it is going to take me.  If it isn't enough then I rinse and repeat until I am where I want to be.  I use the same methodology for alcohol, chocolate, and sex (sort of.  more like do it once and decide if I want to do it again or just roll over and sit in the bliss   )",

(BruceBanner),Cannabis Road Discussion/General Discussion,"Ramble all you like mate,thats what a forum is for-the free flow of information and ideas.Its all related to a high THC content what we are discussing so hopefully the OP wont mind.  You are not alone,personally i like up strains but you do have to see if it agress with you first.At the  cup in  Amsterdam the guys who manage the Dampkring got me and my old growing/breeding partner absolutely off this planet on exotic sativas,started out with the sat dom hybrids like Amnesia[the real cut not Somas weak imitation[[hypro have a good representation in seed form though] and worked through to Mexi landrace which was like coke but better.Lights had been turned up,everything shimmering and bright,lovely feeling of a mix of stimulation and depression on the central nervous system, bit like a speedball type effect[so people tell me].  For me i prefer the less wired and gentle soaring sativa goodness of something like Pursang Haze or highland Thai.Thing is unless you do it yourself or can buy it from a specialist grower then you will be limited to the commercial varieties which flower in under 10 wks. 12-22 wk flowerers are not popular with people only in it for the money,its these people that are cluster-fuck breeding so if it was up to them 9wk flowering indicas are all we would have,they might not set out to do it but that is the effect of not keeping heirloom strains going and losing the chromosnes,once they go thats it.We already lost real purple haze at one stage though i think some folks have reowkrd it but its not the infamous Haze Bros strain from the 70's.  Thank goodness there are still poeple around who care,i was surprsed at the amount of landrace available on here and where there are landraces and long flowering sats.quality hash you will find dedicated cannabis souls aswell.  Variety is the spice Copycat.",

A 12% THC strain might have a superior high to a 30%THC strain.  There is a group or collective who you can find on Shantibaba & Howard Marks website called CBD crew,these guys n gals are going in the opposite direction and are breeding seeds of strains for high CBD content for medical treatments.

I dreamed about an asymptotic analysis of the Whole Ganja experience. However, the question, as presented, is actually quite hard to answer since I really have no point of reference. The stuff that I smoke (AE) is rumored to be right up there with the highest THC strains, but converting that to an actual number is a more complex problem.   Anyway, man, like, you could always start with one good puff, drink some coffee, have a cigar, and evaluate the elevation. So, is there really much difference between a one hit wonder and a two or three hit wonder, I wonder. What about a pound of shake, can it still make you the same baked?

That being said and after beginning the travels down the Green Bricked Road of CR, I have gained a new found respect for everything, not to mention ECC's LSD.  At first it wasn't my favorite just because of flavor, but now it is one of my tops and I am keeping a stash for special times.  Funny how things change.  My goal is to try as much variety as I can and support the good vendors.

I havent had much luck with large tanks for anything other than e-cig juice.  BHOGarts stuff is pretty thick like molassis.  The NV Cali is perfect; just drop a dab in the little chamber every couple of smoking sessions.    In short: 5/5/5 for BHOGart.  (4/5 for Cannabis Road for not having a vacation mode) Will order from again.   -OhMyMy   http://cannabiskofvl7pa.onion/vendor-profile/BHOgart",

By Wed mid-day it was in transit. Received today to east of Mississippi.   Stealth & Packaging: 5/5 - A+++. I have received a LOT of cannabis through the mail and this is the second best I have ever seen. Shipping location actually surprised me. Was packaged and sealed 110% correctly. Great visual barriers.   Communication: 5/5 but N/A. No need to communicate about anything, but seeing how friendly and helpful and active they are on the forums, I already know that if you needed to communicate, you would have no problems.   Trust: 5/5. I FE'd, which I used to never do. However, seeing that shit happens on marketplaces every day, I research my vendors and go with my gut on their trust, as I can imagine the hit that long-term vendors have suffered over the past few years, and this vendor can definitely be trusted.   Product: 5/5 A+ Haven't weighed it, but no need to. Like I said, I trust this vendor, and I wouldn't doubt if it's actually a little heavy.   Strains Received:  1. Rainbow Jones - indica - It's great. Packed up a bowl and wound up taking 3 hits (long day) within 10 minutes and I am on top of the rainbow right now. Note that I did pop a pain pill about 5 hours ago so it may have enhanced a bit, but...I'm pretty fucking high right now. I had seen where TBC said that a few seeds may had been included, but unfortunately, there weren't any, or they would be getting put in soil right now.   2. Bubba Kush - indica - Haven't tried it yet, but I love BK. I already know I won't be disappointed. So if you like BK or another heavy indica, it's the way to go.   TL;DR: Great vendor, great products. Trustworthy. Highly recommended and definitely will be repeat customer.   ",

Product: 5/5 The bag appeal with this vendor is insaaaaaaaaaane. The entire weight consisted of VERY large, green trees with leaves covered in crystals. This is actually some of the best looking bud I've yet to receive off the DN. I got TBC's blend, so it was accurately overweight by a little over 2 grams (awesome deal/option in my opinion btw). Since it's a combination of their 3 most stocked strains at time of ordering, I'm not sure exactly which strain I'm smoking. However, I did mention when ordering that I prefer a sativa leaning strain and this definitely delivers that, so I'm super happy!  I'd also like to mention that their communication is detailed, prompt and friendly.  Anyway, there are so many nice things that I feel I could say, but to wrap it up - TBC is my new go to weed vendor. A+",

Stealth: 5/5   Communication:5/5 I had a question after I placed my order and they responded the same night, vendor was very professional and nice.  Product: 5/5 My favorite part  . All the buds were huge and sparkling with THC crystals and hairs. They will stick to your fingers big time.  I ordered 3 diffrent strains, I got the Maui Waui mix, Tropical Thunderfuck, and Chocolope Skywalker. I dont have a scale but just by looking at it I can tell its overweight, which is what TBC offers on some of their strains.  Maui Waui: Holy shit, this stuff gave me a heart pounding out of my chest, energetic, super head high. Its a very chill high and makes you wanna get up and do something, it brings you down slow into a nice mellow high that lasts for a couple hours. Tasted somewhat fruity. One of my new favorites  .  Tropical Thunderfuck: I smoked a J of this strain about 5 hours after I smoked the Maui Waui. It started with a light cerebral high and then worked its way down my body and left me numb and napping for a few hours lol. Very fruity taste and smooth smoke.  Chocolope Skywalker: This strain I smoked after I woke up from my TT nap. Rolled another J with this and hotboxed in the car.(Note: Ive smoked all this with my gf so its been js between 2 people to give you an idea of how good this shit is.)After this one I was fried, My whole body was numb and I had a very euphoric head high where my head felt like it was 1000 lbs. Earthy and fruity taste.   TL:DR To sum it up this was my first order with TBC and will definitely not be my last. Great vendor, great shipping, fantastic product! Thanks TBC    ",

","Everything I sell here is grown by me personally, so it's all my personal garden.  I don't distribute bud for other growers.  And I don't have a corner or a special room with the good plants for me and my staff.  If you're asking if there are some plants that I devote extra time to for my personal head stash...  no way.   If anything, the opposite is true.  My best product ships out to my loyal customers and friends.  As for the future of this business for growers like me.  Honestly, it's hard to be optimistic.  It's hard to be optimistic in the medium and long-term.  Like every industry, the big industrial sized operations will suck up the most of the business by being ruthlessly efficient (translation, by underpaying undocumented mexican migrant workers to do all the labor intensive parts of the growing business.  Will there be room for a high end specialty grower like there's small output microbreweries and small-output Napa wineries?  Hopefully, but I have a hard time seeing a niche in a legal cannabis industry that I will want to be involved in.    The cold hard truth of it is that the reason I make a comfortable living doing this is because there is a price premium built into the price for bud these days that pays me for the legal risks of my occupation.   I'm good with that because I'm careful and stay below the radar.  In a legal cannabis landscape, the price of bud for consumers may stay in the same general range as it is now, but instead of growers enjoying that risk profit, the government will be taking that in sin taxes on recreational cannabis.  And growers who aren't taking advantage of underpaid workers won't be making a living at all.   I wish I didn't see it that way, but I don't see how it could turn out any other way.  My personal opinion is that California laws on cannabis are pretty good for me right now.  With liberal medical regulation of cannabis, we haven't seen big taxes levied on cannabis sales becuase that would be like taxing life-saving medicine which governments don't tend to do.  Anyone here can get a prescription if they put a little effort into it, but medical users AREN'T paying the 30% taxes that Colorado recreational users are paying.  Just my humble opinion.Jack"

Honestly, the first two paragraphs, I probably know less than half of the words you said. No wonder why you don't see the bud quality that you grow around more often, it must be hard. It is quite discouraging but I like being realistic, I wouldn't wanna invest a lot of money not knowing exactly what I was getting into.  But mainly what im understanding from you said is: 1. Know the technology, not just the botany. 2. If you think you know everything, you know nothing. (applies to everything in life imo) 3. Need money to invest. 4. Experience is key. (If I knew your methods excatly I still wouldnt be able to apply them as well) 5. Internet has more misinformation than truth.   I think all growers should think like you. Most of the bud around here (local, not dnm) looks bad. Doesn't smell good, look good, or smoke good, just grown rushed and for money, you gotta take pride in your product. I wish every grower flushed what they grew until they were happy with the results instead of flooding towns with inferior product lol.  Ok couple more questions if you dont mind. Do you have a personal garden? I would imagine its watered by the fountain of youth and absolutey some perfect bud, like one hitter quitter shit lol. And what do you think the future of growers will be like? And by that I mean legalization is inevitable so who will grow our countries weed. Will all the weed be amazing and only the top growers will have a job. I imagine it will be flooded so will they even make good money. Whats the difference between someone growing legally in Colorado and someone illegally in a nonmedical state today.  Thanks   edit: some spelling","Quote from: harrypothead696 on June 25, 2014, 07:43:17 amHey its harrypothead666 but I forgot my password so new account.Thanks for the response! Another couple questions, did someone teach you or did you like read books or something? Also do you think if I wanted to become a personal grower ( 5 or 6 plants for myself to smoke) that I could achieve that quality without 18 years of experience lol the less plants the more attention you can give one right? But I have absolutely no experience in botany. Everyones dream is to grow weed right?Thanks!Unfortunately the biggest factor has nothing to do with number of plants/amount of attention and time you spend talking to them.  A lot of the things you do to make incremental improvements in an indoor growing operation require pretty big investments of capital, and in many cases, remodelling.  Let's start with discussing your possible growing space and you'll see how you quickly run into limitations.  I started growing in the closet of a studio apartment in San Francisco with a single 400 watt light.  With the closet door closet, it gets quickly stifling hot and pretty humid (both bad things -- ideal temp for indoor growing is 75 to 80 F, a bit higher with supplemental CO2).  Even worse, you get stagnant air and not much in the way or fresh air exchange.  So during the time the lights are on, the air in the closet will quickly get depleted of CO2, and the plants will pretty much cease growing until they get more CO2.  Similar problem but with oxygen when the lights are off (plants breath oxygen like we do when the sun isn't shining.  So when you're growing a couple of plants in a closet, you quickly run into a few huge problems that are quickly going to limit just how good your results will be.  At the time, my friends and me thought my studio closet blueberry was pretty top notch.  Now I know better.  A major limitation of that setup was also the wattage.  Growing with anything less than a 600W HID light source will really impact your results.  When I bought my first country house and upgraded to 1000 W lighting, it was like I was growing a completely different plant species.  Cannabis under 1000 W lighting looks nothing like cannabis under 400 W lighting.I'll digress here, at the risk of inflaming a certain group of LED lighting afficionados.  Don't even get me started on LED lighting.  It may be the future of indoor growing, but it's not here yet.  HID lighting is actually a relatively efficient light source as opposed to incandescent lights that are going the way of the dinosaur.  Most public utilities still use high pressure sodium lights for street lights because of their efficiency -- not for the unflattering color it casts on your skin standing under one.  LED's may get there someday, but for now trust me, HPS HID lights are the only way to go for the best buds.  (IMHO that is).  A single 1000W HPS HID light outputs 143,000 lumens (compare that to the lumen output on the biggest most powerful LED replacement bulb at Home Depot to get an ideal -- theu are typically rated in the hundreds of lumens, maybe getting up to the low 1000's for the most advanced models.  Please no flames from the LED lighting backers and cultists out there.  If LED's were so good, then why do the huge majority of growers out here still use HID lights?  California electricity prices are among the highest in the country.  If LED lights gave superior results, Californians would have switched by now.I'm not a botanist by education.  I bought one of those Rosenberg books early on and used that until someone borrowed it and didn't return it.  Since then my education has been mostly through googling.  Please believe me when I tell you that the vast majority of posts in grower's forum on-line are filled with rumor and misinformation.  I would swear that most of the people submitting most of the posts on those sites don't actually grow cannabis, they just read about it on forum threads all day.  I have read 1000's of on-line posts in forums and have never posted once.  Primarily because I am aware that without all of the details of a specific situation or problem a grower is having, my ability to diagnose and provide advice is questionable at best.  I could easily lead someone in the wrong direction if I was missing a single crucial bit of information.  It never ceases to amaze me that the most prolific posters on those forums: (1) usually have it wrong -- not a little wrong, pretty much all wrong; (2) they are the most insistent that they are right and everyone else is wrong; (3) they never even admit the slightest doubt that there could be other answers or diagnoses.  If you do go down the path of learning by forum, take this advice.  If they write as if they know everything and they excude confidence, ignore everything they say. Just my 2 cents worth of advice.  Feel free to ignore it.I really have to work at writing shorter posts.  TL:DR again.  Here's the bottom line - sure you can try out growing as a hobby in your closet, but don't expect to get the same results as professional growers.  In my grow rooms I have complete control of the climate including temp, humidity, liquid nutient temp in the hydroponic circulation, redundant backup systems in case of primary equipment failures (otherwise you can lose an entire crop in a matter of hours with an advanced hydroponic growing system), powerful but quiet high CFM ventilation and circulation systems, water chiller and split air conditioning system, automatic ph and nutrient concentration monitoring and automatic dosing to correct the ph and nutrient levels, carbon filtration to keep the fragrance out of your neighborhood (my closet grow lacked that feature and that's why my landlord asked me to leave).  Sorry if this is discouraging news but I wanted to give you a realistic picture.  By nature I'm more of a tech geek than a green thumb and in a sophisticated system like I run, that's probably the skill set that's most important.  I'm not unusually successful with ordinary house plants or tomato plants in my outdoor garden.  I've been doing this long enough to know if my girls look happy or not.  If not, I try to find out why not and go from there.  Even now I'm still running into new challenges.  It helps keep it interesting.Jack"

But I have absolutely no experience in botany. Everyones dream is to grow weed right? Thanks!","Quote from: harrypothead666 on June 20, 2014, 03:46:21 pmWow! This is truly some magazine shit. How long did it take you to acheive this beauty with your plants? Like how many harvests until you perfected your methods, just wondering?I've been growing indoor hydro weed for about 18 years now (yeah don't tell me, that means I'm prettty old, I know).  I guess experience gets you something.  You should have seen some of the disasters of my early crops and I've still been known to make mistakes even pretty recently.  But practice and experience definitely helps."

For a complete update on the summer crop and when it will be ready (very very soon), check out my review thread.  I plan to have a post with all new information by the end of the day today.  Here's a link to my review thread.   http://forumzxmoorof4ja.onion/index.php?topic=69.0  Cheers, Jack",Anybody know what's going on with JB?His vendor account is gone on the market.

Bottom line is it's not that hard and I'll help you out with it when you place an order if you're still stuck.  And I accept some (OK a lot) of the blame for the tutorials not being easy to understand.  I had promised crypto i would help with the tutorials a couple of months ago and life got in the way.  I guess I should follow through on that promise.

I would imagine its watered by the fountain of youth and absolutey some perfect bud, like one hitter quitter shit lol.And what do you think the future of growers will be like? And by that I mean legalization is inevitable so who will grow our countries weed. Will all the weed be amazing and only the top growers will have a job.

I'll digress here, at the risk of inflaming a certain group of LED lighting afficionados.  Don't even get me started on LED lighting.  It may be the future of indoor growing, but it's not here yet.  HID lighting is actually a relatively efficient light source as opposed to incandescent lights that are going the way of the dinosaur.  Most public utilities still use high pressure sodium lights for street lights because of their efficiency -- not for the unflattering color it casts on your skin standing under one.  LED's may get there someday, but for now trust me, HPS HID lights are the only way to go for the best buds.  (IMHO that is).  A single 1000W HPS HID light outputs 143,000 lumens (compare that to the lumen output on the biggest most powerful LED replacement bulb at Home Depot to get an ideal -- theu are typically rated in the hundreds of lumens, maybe getting up to the low 1000's for the most advanced models.  Please no flames from the LED lighting backers and cultists out there.  If LED's were so good, then why do the huge majority of growers out here still use HID lights?  California electricity prices are among the highest in the country.  If LED lights gave superior results, Californians would have switched by now.  I'm not a botanist by education.  I bought one of those Rosenberg books early on and used that until someone borrowed it and didn't return it.  Since then my education has been mostly through googling.  Please believe me when I tell you that the vast majority of posts in grower's forum on-line are filled with rumor and misinformation.  I would swear that most of the people submitting most of the posts on those sites don't actually grow cannabis, they just read about it on forum threads all day.  I have read 1000's of on-line posts in forums and have never posted once.  Primarily because I am aware that without all of the details of a specific situation or problem a grower is having, my ability to diagnose and provide advice is questionable at best.  I could easily lead someone in the wrong direction if I was missing a single crucial bit of information.  It never ceases to amaze me that the most prolific posters on those forums: (1) usually have it wrong -- not a little wrong, pretty much all wrong; (2) they are the most insistent that they are right and everyone else is wrong; (3) they never even admit the slightest doubt that there could be other answers or diagnoses.  If you do go down the path of learning by forum, take this advice.  If they write as if they know everything and they excude confidence, ignore everything they say. Just my 2 cents worth of advice.  Feel free to ignore it.  I really have to work at writing shorter posts.  TL:DR again.  Here's the bottom line - sure you can try out growing as a hobby in your closet, but don't expect to get the same results as professional growers.  In my grow rooms I have complete control of the climate including temp, humidity, liquid nutient temp in the hydroponic circulation, redundant backup systems in case of primary equipment failures (otherwise you can lose an entire crop in a matter of hours with an advanced hydroponic growing system), powerful but quiet high CFM ventilation and circulation systems, water chiller and split air conditioning system, automatic ph and nutrient concentration monitoring and automatic dosing to correct the ph and nutrient levels, carbon filtration to keep the fragrance out of your neighborhood (my closet grow lacked that feature and that's why my landlord asked me to leave).  Sorry if this is discouraging news but I wanted to give you a realistic picture.  By nature I'm more of a tech geek than a green thumb and in a sophisticated system like I run, that's probably the skill set that's most important.  I'm not unusually successful with ordinary house plants or tomato plants in my outdoor garden.  I've been doing this long enough to know if my girls look happy or not.  If not, I try to find out why not and go from there.  Even now I'm still running into new challenges.  It helps keep it interesting.

I hate to speak for him, but I am sure that Crypto can help you track the send and will return your messages. Hopefully you have some buds to chill out with in the meantime.   ","(the money was already in my CanRoad wallet)1 Selected 2 items from a vendor's profile and added them to cart.2 verified it was what I wanted and the ammount I desired.3 Added in my encrypted address and proceeded to ""checkout""4 the order did not appear as placed.I went ahead and messaged the vendor and he claimed he did not see an order placed from my end.This is when I made my first support ticket yesterday at about 5 in the morning.Then I decided to send my money from the wallet OUT. To another address and I have et to see it show up in my other wallet. I do not know if it was processed or wha it is rthat happened because my wallet now shows a balance of 0BTC."

I was fairly new to the site and wasn't sure what happened when I thought the order was placed, but didn't show up under My Placed Orders. So I opened a support ticket, it was responded to in an hour or so, and for whatever reason the order didn't go thru. I suspect it was user error.   Keep in mind that there are other users with other issues which may be ahead of yours in the support queue. It has been my experience that tickets are responded to based on priority, and in the order received.   So, let me ask:  Are any funds still missing from your wallet? Have you received a response from support yet?   If your btc didn't show up in your wallet, there are ways to track the transaction in the blockchain. If your btc are intact, I think it is safe to assume that the original order didn't go thru, and you should retry.   Please update this thread when you have gotten resolution to your issue, or need further assistance.  ","Hi,I tried placing an order this morning between 3-5AM US East time with Stratton Oakmont. After I verify that I had:1 sufficient funds2 enter my address encryptedThe order does not show up as placed, I asked the vendor and he claimed to not have received an order from me.

Taste: Smooth, sweet fruity inhale with a slight earthy undertone in the exhale. Delicious!!!  Effects: The fuck just happened? For real I feel like I just lost the game. Damn I love this strain. Everything you see is beautiful. Everything you think is beautiful. Thats probably why this strain is said to be psychedelic. One-hitter quitter potential for even the most occasional smoker. For the true stoner? A couple good bong rips will put your head in the sky. Must try for any smoker!!  Potency: **WARNING** THIS BUD IS STRONG, NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE this strain!! It makes me so happy!! I recommend this strain for anyone, but tread with care!! This bitch is strong, and will have you toasted for a long time!! You will love the adventure though, I guarantee it!! ",

I must begin by admitting i have blatantly followed miss LadyHawk here from the spookily quiet Pandora forums (username Nirvana there also). Hi Lady.  Begin rant... What a wild ride it has been since last October. I had only been in the deepweb for a short few months before all hell broke loose and poor ol' Ross was arrested for our freedom. I hold DPR in hero status in my mind, he created the most amazing platform of trade i have ever seen. I could not believe the Silk Road could work, let alone exist... I purchased some acid from an IRL friend and was like 'damn man those squares are badass, whered you get em?'. My ate smiles that smile where i know he'z gunna tell me something cool. 'The internet' he says. (Life changes right about this moment) 'Bullshit' I say. I was wrong, no bullshit. All of a sudden this magical market was at my disposal, i felt like a politician on a taxpayer funded holiday, a pig in shit, at home in the dark corners of the web.  Then came October. Then came Sheep. Backcopy gracefully a great market. SR2 pretends to carry on the movement. Tormarket appears then dissapears. SR2 and pandora supposedly hacked. Markets Tossing (oops, i mean DDoS'ing) each other. Chaos. Distrust. Media Attention. Arrests.  What happend to our fair Kingdom. We never knew how good we had it with Ross and Backcopy. Legends, true Trailblazers, Heroes that honestly earned Respect.  I still love these places but that 'feeling' has vanished. Those who know, know what 'feeling' i i am talking about.  Tor + BTC + LadyHawk = my world.  Rant over...  PS. hope yall like my post, i may come chill here a bi if its cool with all yalll. I hardly even smoke up anymore (more of a speed freak) but i got a heart'o'gold still Cheers Nirvana",

The aroma begins with a strong earthy skunk and then moves to lighter floral notes of honeysuckle and tea. The high can only be described as very strong, and retains a lot of pleasant sativa features that make it appropriate for some daytime usage. Great for dancing, exercise, and other high energy physical activities. Suitable for pain relief.

Once you get to the finalization screen you'll see 2 boxes.   1) Raw transaction 2) Constructed transaction.  The raw transaction is mainly there for your inspection purposes. It will contain;  1) Where the funds are being sent to once processed 2) Where the funds are coming from (the shared address) 3) Proof that sufficient funds exist in that address by providing the transaction IDs of the payments to that address  You can view this breakdown by taking that raw transaction and putting decoderawtransaction in front of it and pasting it in your Bitcoin QT console.  It would look something like this;  decoderawtransaction 00001111000001111100000, etc.....  And the result would be a breakdown things like address, amount, txid, for those who want to inspect it.  Secondly the constructed transaction basically is a prefilled out command you're going to enter into your console that is going to add your signature to the raw transaction.  The only thing you need to change is where it says YOURPRIVATEKEYHERE, you need to replace that with your compressed private key and then hit enter.  You'll get a result that looks something like this.   Except your hex output is going to be much bigger. Copy that hex output and disregard everything else. So you would be copying only the  010000002222000000000000...etc  This hex result is the raw transaction with your signature added to it. You have completed the ""sign"" portion, now you just need to return it.  Next you paste the copied hex code into the open box on the bottom of the finalization screen and click submit! If you entered the correct private key, you should receive a confirmation that your funds have been released and a transaction ID as proof of the success!","""hex"" : ""010000002222000000000000.....etc"",""complete"" : false}"
Cannabis Road 2,7498fbae52acbe50ec2807925ed83220eb7509636b4567d0c253d9a441891762,372.0,2014-06-26T18:18:29,How to use the Multisignature Payment System,Official Market Announcements/Tutorials," At this point the seller will enter their  private key, which is basically providing 1 of the 2 required signatures to release the funds.   Finally the market will provide it's  private key automatically to release the funds to the seller.   At this point the funds will be released to the seller.  So remember, the only important things you need to perform this are.  Compressed public key Compressed private key A personal Bitcoin address for your funds to be sent to. This can be your Blockchain wallet, your Bitcoin Fog wallet, any wallet.  Public keys are used to generate the multisig address. Private keys are used to spend or release the funds from the multisig address.",
Cannabis Road 2,7498fbae52acbe50ec2807925ed83220eb7509636b4567d0c253d9a441891762,372.0,2014-06-26T18:14:52,How to use the Multisignature Payment System,Official Market Announcements/Tutorials,"Ok so back to Multisignature addresses.  A multisignature address is generated having the following goals in mind.    1) In order to spend funds in a normal Bitcoin wallet, you need the private key. In order to spend funds in a multisignature wallet you may need multiple keys. What do I mean by  may need?  When generated multisignature addresses you can choose how many private keys are required to spend the funds. So for example you can use 2 public keys to generate the multisig address, and require only 1 private key to spend them. This seems like a stupid idea since it defeats the purpose of  MULTISIGNATURE addresses, but technically you could.   A better idea is to generated a multisig addresses with 2 public keys that require 2 private keys to spend the funds. This is a little bit more safer because it requires both the buyer and the seller to agree on the transaction in order to release the funds. The problem is, if a buyer or seller has a dispute or one is trying to scam the other, they may never agree to provide their private key to release the funds. This is where we come in at Cannabis Road.   We use what's described as a 2 of 3 multisig address.   The buyer supplies a public key, the seller supplies a public key and the market supplies a public key.  The multisig address is then set up to require 2 private keys to spend the funds. This way, if the buyer and seller can't agree on who should get the funds, the market can be the tie breaker and settle the dispute.   This protects the  buyer from a scammer  seller This protects the  seller from a scammer  buyer This protects the  buyer and  seller from a scamming  market.   The reason is because no one individual has more than 1 private key, and 2 are required to spend the funds. So therefore everyone is protected from everyone else and the market can handle the tie breakers in case of a buyer/seller dispute.   So let's recap what we learned so far.   Buyer's public key Seller's publc key Market's public key  Are all put together to make 1 multisig address that requires 2 out of the 3 private keys to spend the funds.   So once the new multisig address is generated, this is where the buyer will send their funds.  Then once the buyer receives their item or the seller requests early finalisation, the seller will first provide their private key, then the buyer will provide their private key and the funds will be released to the seller.  It really is not very complicated, but I have seen alot of people complaining about how complicated it is.   Now that we talked about the theory of multisig, let's show you how you apply this to Cannabis Road.",
Cannabis Road 2,7498fbae52acbe50ec2807925ed83220eb7509636b4567d0c253d9a441891762,372.0,2014-06-26T18:45:30,How to use the Multisignature Payment System,Official Market Announcements/Tutorials," Now let's talk specifically about the  broadcast method.  If you haven't already, I suggest you read the sign and return method because these two methods are very similar.   On the finalization screen you will see two filled out boxes  1) Raw transaction 2) Constructed transaction.  The raw transaction is mainly there for your inspection purposes. It will contain;  1) Where the funds are being sent to once processed 2) Where the funds are coming from (the shared address) 3) Proof that sufficient funds exist in that address by providing the transaction IDs of the payments to that address 4) Unlike the sign and return method, this raw transaction already has the market's signature added to it.   You can view this breakdown by taking that raw transaction and putting decoderawtransaction in front of it and pasting it in your Bitcoin QT console.  It would look something like this;  decoderawtransaction 00001111000001111100000, etc.....  And the result would be a breakdown things like address, amount, txid, for those who want to inspect it.  Secondly the constructed transaction basically is a prefilled out command you're going to enter into your console that is going to add your signature to the raw transaction.  The only thing you need to change is where it says YOURPRIVATEKEYHERE, you need to replace that with your compressed private key and then hit enter.  You'll get a result that looks something like this.   Now, you will notice, that in the case of the broadcast method, unlike the sign and return method, it says ""complete"" : true instead of false.  This is because in the sign and return method the seller is adding their signature first, and the market will add it's signature second. So the complete false, is just basically saying, WE STILL NEED OUR SECOND SIGNATURE before this transaction is complete.  In the broadcast method, the seller is adding the second signature, so you will get the complete : true.  So just like the sign and return method, copy that hex output and disregard everything else. So you would be copying only the  010000002222000000000000...etc  This hex result is the raw transaction with your signature added to it. You have completed the ""sign"" portion, now you just need to  broadcast it  At this point you are still using your Bitcoin QT client, and you are going to broadcast your own transaction to the bitcoin network.   This is where it becomes important to make sure your Bitcoin QT client is connected through Tor, because the Bitcoin network will be saving your IP address when you broadcast the transaction. If you don't know how to do this, look about 2 posts above this one and you will see instructions on how to connect your Bitcoin QT client through Tor. Also this is the main reason why people may opt to perform the sign and return method instead of broadcasting their own transaction, because it makes the market doing the broadcasting instead.  To broadcast your own transaction take your copied hex output    010000002222000000000000...etc  And enter;  sendrawtransaction 010000002222000000000000...etc  Into the Bitcoin QT console. The result will be a transaction ID that you can view on Blockchain.info to verify the transaction has been successfully picked up by the Bitcoin network.  If you get a ""FALSE"" result, you have likely incorrectly entered your private key.  Another downside to the broadcast method, is that the speed of which your transaction is confirmed may be slower because you must wait for your transaction to be picked up by the majority (at least 51%) of the Bitcoin network, and most Bitcoin QT clients are connected to about 8 other Bitcoin nodes.  The market's client is connected to dozens of nodes and your transaction will spread quicker if you use the sign and return method.  But if you wish to have the most control over your transaction, the broadcast method is for you.","""hex"" : ""010000002222000000000000.....etc"",""complete"" : true}"

To do this, open Bitcoin QT and go to Settings, then Options, then Network.  You must have Tor or Tor Browser Bundle open at this point.

Under  My Account -> My Placed Orders  It will say  Require Buyer's Action - Resolve  Click on Resolve and you will be presented with an address to send your market fee to.   First thing the buyer has to do is send a 4% market fee directly to the market. This is because there's no good way of making sure the market gets their fees using multisig unless the buyer sends their market fee first to the market.  After the market receives their fee, the buyer will be asked for their public key and their refund address.  You can generate your public key and private key pair at BitAddress.org or BrainWallet.org.  The  refund address is where funds will be returned if there is a dispute of which you are the winner.   Next the seller will be asked for their public key and their address to where the funds will be sent once the order is finalized.   Finally the market generates their public key and combines it with the other public keys to generate a multisignature address.   The buyer and seller will be presented with the multisg address and all 3 public keys in case they want to verify that the address was generated using those 3 public keys. Most people don't need to do this, but some people demand that they have access to all the keys to make sure the market isn't trying to scam them.  The buyer will then be asked to send the remaining 96% of the order's cost to the multisig address.   Next the seller will be asked to either ship the item or the buyer can finalize early.   Once the buyer finalizes, the seller will be presented with three options.  1) Private Key method 2) Sign and Return method 3) Broadcast method  These 3 methods will be discussed in detail in subsequent posts.",

So you wanna make a payment using the new multisignature system? Most people are getting scared away by this and we have been reading posts on Reddit and other forums about how buyers are getting intimidated by the multisig system because it's too complicated. Well my goal is to set your mind at ease by explaining it to you as if you were a retard. No offense meant.    First of all, let's look at a normal Bitcoin address. You can generate unlimited Bitcoin addresses at   https://www.bitaddress.org/  http://brainwallet.org/  On BitAddress you can click ""Generate new Address"" a bunch of times, until you are happy.  On the left hand side, you'll see a  Bitcoin address and on the right hand side you'll see a  private key.  Copy the private key, and click on the tab  Wallet Details and paste it in the box where it says  Enter Private Key and click  View Details.  You're gonna see a bunch of numbers pop up. Uncompressed address, public key and private key. As well as compressed address, public key and private key.   The private key is what you use to spend your funds. If you've ever used any Bitcoin client other than Blockchain, you know that the private key is the only really important number you need, the rest can be generated from the private key.   The difference between compressed and uncompressed is that compressed takes us less space in the Blockchain. Most people don't know this, but each transaction in Bitcoin is a certain size and for those of you who use Bitcoin QT, you know how long it takes to download the entire Blockchain every time you install it on another computer.  If you go to  https://blockchain.info/ you can see what I mean. On the right hand side you'll see for each block,  Size (kB)   Well, compressed keys and addresses take up less space in the Blockchain, so they were designed so that the Blockchain doesn't get too big too quickly. So for the forseeable future, we're gonna use compressed addresses, public keys and private keys.  So you're gonna wanna select these numbers for your Bitcoin wallet (but use the numbers you generated)   Public Key (compressed, 66 characters [0-9A-F]): 02F4027E28BC285F03CEE44882060408A52EDB4DCC50CFBA6C09E80238FF0E29EA   Bitcoin Address Compressed 1JGPd4o2qMgViGYu54GPyYzcvzCiCnUwYg   Private Key WIF Compressed52 characters base58, starts with a 'K' or 'L' L265ZwzJmGUJ4eJZY1b8qidQjGhYg6gHnxydrKjg3v2bt4Xgso13  With me so far?  All you need to know is to select the compressed versions of the keys every time.   Just a little explanation here, when your private key is generated, a corresponding public key is generated. The private key is your spending key and the public key is your receiving key, but in order to make Bitcoin more manageable, Bitcoin further refined your public key using multiple mathematical equations down into a 27-34 character address.  For those who want an indepth tutorial on how these numbers are generated, read this tutorial.  https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Technical_background_of_Bitcoin_addresses  So for our purposes in multisig, we mainly need the compressed public key and compressed private key, just remember that. The address really isn't important in the case of multisig but I wanted you to understand the addressess' role in Bitcoin wallets first. Nobody uses public keys to receive money because they take up way too much space, so we refined it down to addresses which are about 50% - 75% smaller.  Again, think about how long it takes you to download the Blockchain every time you install Bitcoin QT, saving space is an important goal for Bitcoin.  Ok, now that we have our compressed public key and private key, let's move on to the next step.",

The intention, at least originally, was rather to make certain people opened the link manually through TOR, and not through their clearnet browser.  Theoretically, going to clearnet links that you saw on the darknet is a way to easily get deanonymized.  If I were in law enforcement, for example, I may post a link to a law-enforcement controlled clearnet server on a vendor's discussion forum. Something like  www.fakedruginformationdomainname.com/stuff. The law enforcement could then look at all the people who accessed that very specific LEO-controlled domain and correctly ascertain that ALL of them were vendors or darknet-related IP addresses.   So to summarize: you've got it backwards Pyro! Never ever open any clearnet links you find on the darknet on your clearnet browser, keep it IN TOR, where you are (at least we hope) mostly safe.      Regarding the article, I think this one is primarily directed at hidden service operators, who should probably have a bit of sweaty palm syndrome going on reading that I'm sure. It would take a crazy amount of effort to try to deanonymize a single random tor user in the hope they are someone 'important,' one has to imagine the vast majority of the deanonymization efforts are targeted at the big fish.

Today, the Tor Project blog announced that an unknown party likely managed to gather information about people who were looking up hidden services  websites that users can operate and visit anonymously, like Silk Road  and could theoretically have compromised other parts of the network.   Anyone who used Tor between early February and July 4th of 2014 ""should assume they were affected"" by the attack, says the Tor team. But they don't know what exactly that means. The attackers specifically looked for who was retrieving the public keys to hidden services, but they ""likely were not able to see any application-level traffic (e.g. what pages were loaded or even whether users visited the hidden service they looked up),"" says the blog post. ""The attack probably also tried to learn who published hidden service descriptors, which would allow the attackers to learn the location of that hidden service."" It's possible, but less likely, that they also attempted to identify users who were just browsing the ordinary web through Tor.   >edit: also reported on DeepDotWeb, front page.edit2: corrected erroneous tech detail (see quoted)",

Shipping speed was lightning fast and was in my hands the same week i ordered.  The package was very sturdy and generic looking, well sealed , printed label but had real stamp postage.  It looked very professional even with the stamps and labels perfectly lined up OCD style.    It blended in with my other typical mail.  KUDOS! The inside stealth was very well done.  This is my top 2 packages when it comes to stealth.  Very good physical and visual barrier.  Absolutely no smell outside the package or even when opened and rifled through.  My neighbors must think I'm a weirdo when I sniff my packages while out at the mailbox.  I kid, I kid.  I wait until I'm inside to do that.  Multiple layers both visual and smell proof.  I did not smell anything until I opened the last layer.  I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that it is crush proof.  I ordered strawberry cough and it has very good bag appeal.  The weight was a hair over if my scale is accurate enough (cheapo chinese .000 scale, accurate enough for me unless i need to go sub milligram)  The smell is very pleasant and fruity with a hint of musk.  I would not go as far as saying skunk at all.  Just a light musk.   The bud is attractive and not compressed at all.  It has a good mix of white, yellows, light and dark greens  but no crystals/sugar.   It isn't sticky either (like ECC's LSD    The baggie was just about all nugs and very very little shake.   The largest nugget was about 1.4-1.5 grams and I don't see many stems.  The shake most likely was from packaging and getting jostled around a few days in the mail.  I do not see any seeds.  Trim job is average to above average from what I've seen.   For the price I'd say this is a killer deal.  I will update once I've been able to sample it but I will say this:  My experience up to this point has gone better than expected.  It looks like Mr. Chipperson is proud of their product and takes their time and does it right.   Here's to hoping that the vape experience matches up to the rest of my experience.

Note that the technique may compress some buds, but I'm not entering mine in any beauty pagents or anything, so I appreciate the stealth over the bag appeal. You can tell you're dealing with a professional.   Communication: 5/5 (N/A) - He replied the day order was placed to let me know he received it. There was no reason for any additional communication.

Once you link your bank account you can purchase bitcoin with your checking account and receive the bitcoin in your Coinbase account in 3-4 days.  Coinbase charges a 1% fee to buy or sell bitcoin, and customers with verified ID can buy or sell up to 50 bitcoin per day. Anyone can use the Coinbase wallet but at present you need a USA bank account to buy or sell bitcoin.  LocalBitcoins.com allows you to buy bitcoin in person from local traders using cash or from sellers online and has an escrow service built in.  Cash Into Coins ( https://cashintocoins.com) is a new service (US only) that allows you to deposit cash at your local bank and receive bitcoins in about a day.  You can also buy bitcoin with a credit or debit card through btcQuick ( https://www.btcquick.com). btcQuick charges a fee of 7.5% to buy bitcoin. Selling bitcoin is not available at present but planned. btcQuick is currently not accepting orders from USA customers.  Can bitcoin be purchased using Paypal? Yes, there are sellers on LocalBitcoins.com who accept Paypal. You can also use Paypal to purchase bitcoin indirectly through VirWox, but fees are higher than other options.

Official JackBlue vendor review thread,Vendors/Official Vendor Review Threads,"I just read the seriously terrible news from Crypto about the hack/theft from CR.  I don't know how this is going to end up, but wanted to make sure anyone who wanted to stay in touch has my email contact information.  First I want to explain the steps you have to take to use email safely while maintaining your privacy and safety (and mine as well).    First, you should set up a special email account that you only use for Tor/Darknet business matters.  NEVER use the same email to contact anyone who has any connection to you at all in real life.    Second, you need to make sure that the email provider you use allows you to create an account from within the Tor browser, and also allows you to send and receive mail from the Tor browser.  When you sign up for the account, do not provide any real life personally identifiable information (like another email address).  Never check your mail or send mail when not using the Tor browser.  If you do by mistake sometime, trash that email account and start over.  This is very important.  There are only a very limited number of free email providers that meet all these requirements.   Safe-mail.net is one, which is why many vendors use safe-mail as a backup email address.  Riseup.net will also work, but you need two people with accounts there to give you invite codes to create an account there.  There are probably other providers that I'm not familiar with.  Third, ALWAYS encrypt every email you send to anyone from your darknet email account.   I've posted my GPG public key at the end of this message.   If you send me an email, please make sure and tell me what your username was on CR so I recognize you.  And remember to include your GPG public key so I can reply to your message.

That's what ordering from Jack is like, and he has all the tools to make sure the process goes as smooth as possible. Communication  was 10/5 if anything, we kicked the can about various topics including weed, growing rooms, and life in general. A truly down to earth vendor who will calm your qualms you might have before ordering.  Now Jack is a multisig escrow user only, and he's rightly so. The effort required to set up Multisig pales in comparison to what you get in return.   Product is straight fire 5+++/5, and I've been around the bush quite a many times. True top shelf quality, the skunky inhale and the minty exhale scenting the room with a thick musk of flavor and smell. The GSC truly is a fine smoke and easy on the lungs as well which means bigger bigger bong rips! If you don't believe me here are pics of exactly what this is all about.

Stealth was very very adequate 5/5, and some of the thickest mylar I've ever seen. I'd prefer to not give many details as this can easily be identifiable. Just know that no one will ever know what's coming to you!  Shipping was well within USPS's limits and the order was put in the mail right away! 3 days West to East. 5/5  Jack stays hidden for a reason, and I believe that way works best for everyone. When you have someone who is a friend first, and an unbelievable Vendor second, its no clue to why one might want to keep it a secret.    Keep on keeping on Jack, and thank you again!   IJWGW    ",

I was shipping GSC as it was curing.  The earliest of the GSC to cure would have been the smaller less dense buds.   Some of the fatter really dense buds have only fully cured within the last few days.   From your comments in the forum before the listings went up, I got the impression that some of you were a bit impatient for the listings, so instead of waiting for all the GSC to be fully cured, I shipped the bud as it cured.  I'd be happy to sell you all the fat dense buds next time if you're willing to wait a couple of weeks longer.  Just let me know that's what you want to do and I'll make it happen.  The same applies anyone else as well.Are we good?  From your ""top shelf"" comment I'm thinking all is good.  If not send me a PM and we can talk about it.Jack"

Official JackBlue vendor review thread,Vendors/Official Vendor Review Threads," Yeah completely normal, one of the factors that influences what kind of concentrate (Wax, shatter, budder etc) you get at the end of an extraction is temptrature; shatter is processed at lower temps and the line between shatter and a gooey consistency is very fine (this I gather from my limited understanding of concentrate production).   For example after carrying around a small amount of shatter in a silicone container in my pocket for a few days the shatter has turned a bit darker and while it still shatters is a noticibly more gooey, almost between the consistency of hard candy and a tootsie roll (I am still able to handle it with ease and potency has not been effected what so ever). Someone correct me if I am wrong, but I believe this transformation is due to the increased heat of being in my pocket, or the heat during shipping in your case.

Weight came in 2 grams over, amazingly great stuff and Jack will definitely be my go to guy in the future for high quality stuff. Keep up the good work man.    On that note, when are the other strains gonna be up for us to try Jack? I haven't seen a couple of your strains that you mentioned in earlier posts but at the same time I know it's quite the process getting it ready for everyone..",

THANK YOU everyone for the enthusiasm, the orders, the generous feedback, and the always welcome messages.  When it's really busy it may take a little while to respond to messages, but i make every effort to reply to all of them.  Finally, thanks Crypto, for doing the things you do.  CR just works, and sometimes people forget how that happens.  He is the technical wizard behind CR who keeps us all safe and he's one of the good guys.   CR is the only place I sell on the dark net, and as long as Crypto is here, I'll be here.  I think with the site running so well, people forget that a lot of hard work goes into making that happen.  Feedback on orders is how you guys tell me you appreciate me.  Next time you're writing feedback for a vendor, I hope you'll also think about telling Crypto how great CR is in a forum post.  And encourage your friends to check out CR, and tell your favorite vendors that they should be here as well.  Have a happy and safe  4th of July.   Cheers, Jack",Patiently waiting for my thin mint cut to show up

Official JackBlue vendor review thread,Vendors/Official Vendor Review Threads,"Jack,  It was your help that did it. Cryto's documentation was nice if your a techno geek, and really care how things work. I (the buyer) just want my weed as simply as possible. I do appreciate all the work done.  Here are my simple steps for buyers.   Select multisig option to buy. Step 1 is to pay the 4% commission. So send the exact BTC to the given address. I copy, and paste these into my wallet then press send. Wait......... Once the 4% BTC has clear you move to Step 2  Step 2 Fill in your wallet address that you would like the BTC returned to, if there is a dispute.   Go to  https://www.bitaddress.org/  http://brainwallet.org/  generate a random address. Copy the compressed public key that looks like this; Public Key (compressed, 66 characters [0-9A-F]): 02F4027E28BC285F03CEE44882060408A52EDB4DCC50CFBA6C09E80238FF0E29EA  This is the public key used in Step 2.  I saw the system generate three public addresses, and a wallet address.  You send your BTC for the product to the address given.  The buyer is done.  The seller does the rest.  edit:  Step 3  After the vendor sets up a multisig address, you must pay the bill by sending BTC to that address.     Not sure how he gets paid yet, or the dispute process. One step at a time.  Once we get use to this, it will be the same questions from all the noobs, over, and over.  None of the ""help"" links worked during the process, BTW. Maybe this will help somebody else.    ",

I received:  1/2 oz of GSC  1/2 oz of Blue Dream  1/2g of GSC Shatter  The last batch I got (GSC and JTR), I had some critical things to say. It was very very good, but I was expecting better. He surely delivered exactly what I expected this time. While not cured as long as I normally do, it was cured appropriately and smokes good. The blue dream is a bit fluffy, but the taste and the effect is there. I give the BD an 8/10.  The GSC (both flower and wax) are FIRE. The flower is so strong I was kind of hesitant to even try the shatter! Very kushy smelling, covered in trichs, tasty, and very well grown, I give the GSC a solid 9.5/10. It is top shelf medicine to be certain, and I am certainly happy with my purchase.  JB is a GREAT vendor who cares about his customers satisfaction with his product, and actually worked with me so I could get exactly what I wanted. I will certainly be back. Thanks again JB!",

The process itself is really easy and the starting point for making it is any shatter or wax that I produce.  The only extra ingredient you need it 190 proof grain alcohol.  If not available in your state you can order it shipped from Wine Chateau in New Jersey.  If you need any advice on winterizing i would be happy to provide it.  Just will not be doing it myself.jack"

This was my 1st multi-sig order, and I was admittedly unsure about the process. It required a bit more communication than usual for a normal sale. With Cryptos updated tutorial and JackBlues kind assistance, the process was smooth and easy. This vendor was courteous, patient and professional throughout.  Multi-sig is now my new normal.  Product -  A big fat bag of deep green dense stinky flowers bristling with trichomespicture perfect High Times centerfold girl scout cookies - one bud weighed 9g! These flowers are as fresh and beautiful as any I have been in the same zip code with. I am trying to keep it real on this review, but I am a bit dazzled, to be honest. The included extras pushed this one over the top.  The 1st couple hits of the gsc made my teeth roots buzz and eye stalks tingly, which is a sign of extreme dankness - a very good first impression! I will report more on the effect and potency as we get to know these girls. I think we're gonna have a good time.    Stealth - Multiple layers of higher than consumer grade visual, smell, and breach protection made sure these beauties reached their intended destination intact.    This order has set a new standard of excellence that will be difficult for others to follow to the satisfaction of this reviewer.   The level of care about the product, and especially customers satisfaction and safety is evident in the JackBlue Experience, and is one I hope to repeat!   *edit: later that nite...  just had a couple rips of the blue dream sample Jack included.

Here's the link to my stealth page where you can find the listings and place orders.  Obviiously I'm not being very exclusive with this first time through selling in stealth mode.  Anyone just has to read this post and they are officially invited to order from my ""stealth"" profile page:   http://cannabiskofvl7pa.onion/stealth-profile/30d4c6c38965af8375ea  Right now Blue Dream and XJ-13 listings are available.  I'll be loading up Fire OG, Girl Scout Cookies, Shatter, and Black Jack listings after I finish updating the photos and product descriptions, so if you're waiting for those strains, be a little patient.  I'm not putting all the inventory in the listings at once.  I'll be adding inventory daily until I'm out of stock, and then I'll post in this thread with updates on what is completely sold out and what is still available.

Here's an article from cnn.     http://money.cnn.com/2014/08/18/technology/security/hospital-chs-hack/  Community Health Systems, which operates 206 hospitals across the United States, announced on Monday that hackers recently broke into its computers and stole data on 4.5 million patients.  Hackers have gained access to their names, Social Security numbers, physical addresses, birthdays and telephone numbers.  Anyone who received treatment from a physician's office tied to a network-owned hospital in the last five years -- or was merely referred there by an outside doctor -- is affected.  The large data breach puts these people at heightened risk of identity fraud. That allows criminals open bank accounts and credit cards on their behalf, take out loans and ruin personal credit history.  The company's hospitals operate in 28 states but have their most significant presence in Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Texas.  CNNMoney quiz: What hackers know about you  Community Health Systems (CYH) hired cybersecurity experts at Mandiant to consult on the hack. They have determined the hackers were in China and used high-end, sophisticated malware to launch the attacks sometime in April and June this year.  The FBI said it's working closely with the hospital network and ""committing significant resources and efforts to target, disrupt, dismantle and arrest the perpetrators.""  Federal investigators and Mandiant told the hospital network those hackers have previously been spotted conducting corporate espionage, targeting valuable information about medical devices. ",

Il vous est aussi recommandé de vérifier la phrase de bienvenue que vous avez entrée dans votre profil afin d'être sûr que c'est la bonne et que vous êtes vraiment là où vous voulez être.   LA BARRE DE NAVIGATION  *HOME : plutôt évident, cela vous renvoi à la page d'accueil.  *ABOUT US : Le texte présentant le site et ses objectifs.   *MESSAGES :votre boîte mail se trouvera ici. Si un petit chiffre apparaît à côté de MESSAGES dans la barre de navigation, c'estq ue vous avez un message et que vous devriez cliquer sur la page des messages   Le chiffre vous indique bien sûr le nombre de messages non-lus que vous avez.  Je vais maintenant vous expliquer la page des messages donc allez-y et appuyez sur MESSAGE (cela renvoi vers  http://cannabiskofvl7pa.onion/message )  Vous verrez à côté de Messages: : Recipient Start New Conversation  Recipient devra être remplacé par le nom d'utilisateur de la personne avec qui vous souhaitez communiquer. L'autre manière (plus pratique) d'envoyer un message à un vendeur est de le faire via la page de profil du vendeur (expliqué plus bas dans la partie Profil)  La même fenêtre s'ouvre quelle que soit la méthode choisie: SEND MESSAGE TO VENDOR (NOM D'UTILISATEUR)  Vous aurez d'abord un cadre avec: la clé PGP du vendeur et quelque chose du genre: -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- Version: GnuPG v2017 MingW32  mQxg(pleins de caractères)ghaV/cA== =cyYP -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----  Si vous maîtriser déjà le cryptage PGP et l'envoi de message vous trouverez ici la clé du vendeur. Copier/collez là dans un document.txt et importez là avec votre logiciel PGP  Cela vous servira à envoyer des messages doublement cryptés depuis votre logiciel avec votre propre clé et celle du vendeur plutôt que d'utiliser le système de cryptage intégré de Cannabis Road (qui est en fait recommandé par les admins du site)  Si vous n'avez rien pigé au paragraphe précédent voici de quoi vous aider: TUTO PGP en FRANCAIS ici:  http://www.shak.fr/blog/protege-communiquer-de-maniere-securisee-avec-gpg/   (!!CLEARNET!!) TELECHARGER gpg4usb :  http://www.gpg4usb.org/   (!!CLEARNET!!) NE PASSEZ AUCUNE COMMANDE sans utiliser pgp c'est un risque pour vous et le vendeur.  En dessous vous trouverez la fenêtre du message:  Entrez votre message à cet endroit.  Vous pouvez envoyer des messages simples avec un cryptage de base pour les questions d'ordre général si c'est juste pour discuter avec le vendeur lorsque vous n'échangez rien de sensible (sensible= quantités, votre adresse...) Mais la meilleure pratique est de commencer pas suivre les directives du vendeur sur son profil s'il en a (nous verrons plus bas comment se rendre sur le profil du vendeur) Si rien n'est indiqué le mieux est du tout crypter (au moins un cryptage de base - voir plus bas) C'est pourquoi vous aurez besoin d'un clé PGP (voir tutoriel)  Pour les messages généraux et non sensibles voici comment fonctionne le système de cryptage mis en place directement sur le site:  Ecrivez normalement votre texte dans le cadre prévu à cet effet  Puis allez en bas à droite dans le cadre et cliquer sur ENCRYPT (UNE FOIS SEULEMENT)  Votre texte se transformera en quelque chose comme ceci: -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----  hQExx...dgjy= (plein de caractères) =H3jt -----END PGP MESSAGE-----  Ceci est votre message crypté  Ensuite cliquez juste sur SUBMIT pour envoyer le message et c'est fait.  Pour les informations plus sensibles ( comme votre adresse ou discuter de la méthode pour rendre le colis indétectable), vous aurez besoin de votre propre logiciel PGP (GPA, GPG4WIN, GPG4USB...) IL vous permettra de crypter vos message avec la clé du vendeur et la votre rendant le décryptage plus difficile donc plus sûr.  Dans ce cas vous devrez crypter votre message dans votre logiciel PGP et ensuite copier/coller le message crypté dans la fenêtre de message et juste cliquer sur SUBMIT (N'APPUYEZ PAS SUR ENCYPT DANS CE CAS)  Maintenant que vous avez vus comment envoyer un message   continuons pour voir où le message réside:   LA BOITE MAIL  Vos message devraient maintenant apparaître dans votre boîe mail ( pas de boîte d'envoi ou de réception ici, juste une unique  boîte mail  Le nom de la personne à qui vous avez envoyé ou dont vous avez reçu un message devrait apparaître sur la gauche.  A côté View Conversation vous fera accéder à l'historique des messages avec ce vendeur. Vous avez sur cette page la possibilité d'effacer individuellement des messages et aussi d'envoyer un message à un vendeur depuis ce fil de discussion. Une couleur rouge à côté de ""view conversation"" indique des messages non-lus et une couleur grise avec ""Replied"" indique les fils de discussion où vous êtes le dernier à avoir répondu.  De retour à la boîte mail principale, à côté de l'historique des messages de l'utilisateur vous avez un bouton Delete qui effacera tous les messages avec l'utilisateur et retirera la ligne de message de la boîte mail. C'est une action sur laquelle il est impossible de revenir comme de nombreuses actions sur le darknet, donc soyez prudent.  Ensuite vous avez la possibilté de marquer à nouveau un message comme non-lu de façon à ce qu'il apparaisse à nouveau en rouge à côté de ""View Conversation""   * LE PORTE MONNAIE (WALLET)  C'est la que la partie financière s'opère:  Pour expliquer le concept du wallet vous devez comprendre que cela ne fonctionne pas comme ebay ou amazon...  Ici sur Cannabis Road vous avez d'abord besoin de charger de l'argent (des BiTCoins dans notre cas) sur le porte-monnaie du site avant de pouvoir le dépenser sur le site pour acheter des trucs.  Il y a aussi des spécificités dues à l'utilisation du BTC comme monnaie d'échange. Si vous avez repéré un item qui coûte 100$ le vendeur règle son prix sur 100$ avant qu'il reçoive le montant de BTC correspondant à 100$ au moment de l'achat. Donc il vous est en fait facturé en BTC au taux de change courant BTC/$ que vous pouvez trouver sur la gauche dans le tableau du bas (les prix sont aussi indiqués en $ et BTC quand vous passer la commande.)  Comme le taux de change du BTC est fluctuant (parfois même très) et que le montant dans votre wallet est en BTC, au fil du temps vous pourriez voir le contenu de votre wallet qui valait 100$ prendre de la valeur et dépasser cette somme (pas un problème pour l'achat) ou en perdre et valoir moins de 100$ (ce qui craint un peu lorsque vous n'avez plus assez dans votre wallet pour acheter.) Il est toujours plus sûr de transférer un peu plus que ce qui est indiqué sur la page du produit au cas ou les taux prennent la mauvaise direction, pour ne pas vous faire avoir lorsque vous voulez acheter votre produit.  Vous devez aussi garder à l'esprit qu'il y a de faibles frais de transfert vers Cannabis Road, qui sont indiqués sur la page du wallet, vous devez aussi prendre ce montant en considération lorsque vous transférez  des BTCs.  Quand vous déposez des BTCs dans votre wallet Cannabis Road vous recevrez en fait 0.0001 BTC de moins que le montant transféré depuis votre porte monnaie perso.  Cette taxe est aussi aussi prélevée si vous débitez de l'argent depuis votre wallet sur Cannabis Road vers un autre porte monnaie BTC.  Le montant minimum que vous pouvez transférer vers ou depuis votre  Wallet Cannabis Road est 0.0002 BTC (qui deviendra 0.0001 BTC après les frais.)  Vous trouverez votre solde sur cette page sous BTC Balance. Votre solde est aussi converti dans la monnaie pour laquelle vous avez configuré votre profil sous Cash Balance.  En dessous vous verrez des cases pour 5 adresses de dépôt (qui sont pour en fait comme 5 adresses liées à votre wallet Cannabis Road.)  Ces cases seront initialement vides donc vous aurez besoin de cliquer sur GENERATE KEY pour faire apparaître vos adresses dans les cases vides (autant de fois que besoin, le maximum étant 5)  Vos adresses ressembleront à ça: 1FTYtwG2PR3ruYvtK8tRT2wvbXYV1N4PSK En dessus de celles-ci vous pourrez aussi voir le montant total de BTCs tansférés sur chaque adresse. La clé générée sera l'adresse que vous aurez besoin de copier/coller comme adresse de destination pour vos transferts vers votre wallet Cannabis Road.  A côté des adresses vous avez un x avec Delete qui effacera l'adresse et la désassociera de votre wallet Cannabis Road En faisant cela SOYEZ TRES ATTENTIF à 2 choses:  1/ Que tous les fonds que vous avez transférés sur votre wallet Cannabis Road par l'intermédiaire de cette adresse ont été entièrement traités et ont bien été crédités sur votre compte.  2/ De ne plus jamais utiliser cette adresse pour transférer des BTCs vers votre wallet, parce que les BTCs n'arriveraient jamais et seraient perdus pour vous.   Quelques choses à savoir sur les BTC. Lorsque vous transférerez un montant en BTC depuis votre porte monnaie BTC personnel ou depuis le site où vous les avez acheter vers l'une des adresses de dépôt ce transfert aura un délai. Il faudra un certain nombre de ""confirmations"" pour autoriser le transfert. Vous aurez besoin d'au moins 3 confirmations pour que le transfert soit validé vers votre wallet C. Road.  Pour savoir quand votre transfert est effectif et complet vous devez vous rendre sur  http://blockchain.info et entrer l'adresse de dépôt que vous avez utilisée pour voir le nombre de confirmation. (ou taper cette URL:  http://blockchain.info/address/L'ADRESSE DE DEPOT QUE VOUS AVEZ UTILISEE)  Vous verrez une page qui vous donnera les informations dont vous avez besoin. Vous devriez voir votre adresse d'envoi, une flèche verte, votre adresse de dépôt (réception) et 2 cases, l'une indiquant X (le nombre) confirmations (Unconfirmed transaction au tout début) et une autre donnant le montant de BTCs en train d'être transférés.  C'EST SEULEMENT QUAND LE NOMBRE DE CONFIRMATIONS ATTEINT 3 QUE VOS BTCs SERONT TRANSFERES ET UTILISABLE DANS VOTRE WALLET C. ROAD.

Comme généralement pour les transactions en Bitcoins l'un des inconvénients est que de nombreuses actions sont irréversibles et n'ont pas de sauvergarde ou de système de récupération.  En fait, sans votre code PIN, votre compte serait comme une carte de débit pour laquelle vous auriez perdu le code PIN que vous ne pourriez jamais retrouver, impossible de transférer d'argent depuis le compte correspondant.

Il vous est conseillé de compléter votre profil afin d'obtenir les meilleurs résultats à vos recherches et d'avoir un compte sûr et fonctionnel en procédant comme indiqué ci-dessous:  a) Cliquez sur le lien MY ACCOUNT dans le coin en haut à gauche de l'écran en dessous de  "" Welcome NOM D'UTILISATEUR ""  Vous êtes alors redirigés vers le panneau MY ACCOUNT je vais vous expliquer les fonctions de bases de chacune des pages que vous voyez:  *CHANGE PASSWORD / PIN. Le titre parle de lui-même Le mot de passe et le code PIN (créés en 2/) sont nécessaire pour en créer de nouveaux. Une autre bonne raison de conserver absolument le code PIN.   *MY SHOPPING CART Où les listings que vous avez choisis de commander finiront une fois que vous aurez sélectionné le produit, l'option d'acheminement, la méthode d'Escrow(paiement différé) etc. Vous viendrez ici pour confirmer vos commandes et procéder au paiement (escrow) de votre commande et vous aurez un lien vers la suite de la procédure où vous renseignerez votre adresse etc. Ceci vous sera expliqué d'ici peu dans un tutoriel dédié à Comment Passer Commande.   *MY PLACED ORDERS  Une fois que vous aurez commandé, vos commandes précédentes et de nombreuses actions telles que le feedback, le transfert des fonds, la réception de l'envoi se trouveront à cet endroit.   *MY PGP UNE FONCTION TRES TRES IMPORTANTE. Je vous l'expliquerai dans un tutoriel dédié à Comment Passer Commande/ le cryptage PGP et comment créer une clé PGP et utiliser un programme de cryptage  En attendant je vous recommande fortement de NE PAS PASSER COMMANDE sans une clé PGP et un programme de cryptage, mais vous pouvez surfer sur le site et déposer des produits dans votre panier sans risque.  Selon moi communiquer votre adresse de livraison sans PGP est comme aller au bordel sans préservatif... Mais vous pouvez vous balader et juste regarder et vous n'attraperez aucun maladie, mais si vous décidez de vous lancer quand même vous risquez un paquet de méchantes maladies. Il se pourrait que vous n'ayez aucun problème mais si vous perdez vous le regretterez amèrement... Et la plupart des vendeurs refuseraient de faire du business avec vous sans cela de toutes façons (exactement comme au bordel à nouveau je suppose.)  Si vous utilisez déjà le cryptage PGP je suggère de créer une nouvelle clé pour vos activités sur le darknet si vous n'avez pas déjà une clé ""dark"". Pour l'ajouter sur le site il vous suffira de cliquer sur l'icône PGP Key, de copier la partie publique de la clé et de cliquer sur submit et voilà, vous êtes enregistré   Si vous n'avez pas compris un mot à ce paragraphe attendez le tutoriel et n'achetez pas encore     *ACCOUNT SETTING    Ceci est la partie que vous voulez compléter pour rendre la navigation comfortable pour vous sur le site.  -COUNTRY : Là vous vous dites sûrement :""Putain non, je ne vais dire ça au site!"" Mais l'utilisation de cette information sert aux filtres qui permettent de trouver les vendeurs qui expédient depuis ou vers votre pays. Cela peut donc s'avérer utile pour chercher les listings. Et vous pouvez de plus le rétablir sur undisclosed (non-communiqué) juste avant de vous déconnécter à chaque fois de manière à ce que cela ne reste pas en mémoire lorsque vous vous reconnectez si cela vous rassure.  -CURRENCY: Choisissez si vous voulez que les prix soient affichés en BTC Bitcoins directement ou si vous voulez voir les prix dans votre monnaie en utilisant les taux de changes avec les Dollars US, EURos, Livre Sterling(GBP)  Dollars Canadiens (CAD) Dollars Australiens (AUD) et affiché les prix dans cette monnaie. Sélectionnez ce qui vous convient. En laissant BTC les prix en USD seront affichés en grand et ceux en BTC en petit (exactement la même chose que si vous choisissez USD en fait.) Choisir n'importe quelle autre monnaie affichera les prix dans la monnaie choisie en grand et ceux en BTC en petit sur les pages de recherche.  Autre information utile: En bas à gauche de toutes les pages du site, vous trouverez un bref tableau des taux de changes dans les monnaies indiquées ci-dessus, ce qui peut aussi s'avérer plutôt pratique.   -WELCOME PHRASE: Protection de base contre le phishing. Ecrivez n'importe quelle phrase que vous aurez choisie et verifiez qu'elle apparaît bien dans le coin en haut à droite juste en dessous de la ligne ""HELLO NOM D'UTILISATEUR"" et au dessus de la ligne ""MY ACCOUNT / LOG OUT""  Elle doit apparaître à chaque fois que vous vous connectez. Si ce n'est pas le cas, quelque chose ne vas pas vérfifiez l'URL, fermez tout et revérifiez l'URL, n'achetez pas, ne retirez/déposez pas de BTC!!! Et ensuite seulement appelez la police pour expliquer votre votre compte sur cannabisroad a probablement été hacké, phishé...  -TWO FACTOR AUTHENTIFICATION: Ne touchez pas à ça pour l'instant si vous ne savez pas ce que cela signifie ou ne comprenez pas réellement le cryptage PGP à double facteur ni n'avez entré une clé PGP. Tout cela sera expliqué dans le tutoriel traitant du cryptage PGP. C'est une fonction de sécurité supplémentaire qui apporte un niveau de protection supplémentaire de vos identifiants de connexion, cela utilise votre clé PGP afin de vous rendre moins vulnérable à un hack de votre compte et à quelqu'un qui tenterait de se connecter avec vos identifiants (il aurait besoin de votre identifiant, mot de passe, code PIN, ET AUSSI de la partie privée de votre clé PGP + de la phrase de passe PGP, mais le pas l'utiliser n'est pas comme aller au bordel sans capote. Vous lirez à ce sujet dans d'autres tutoriels.     *LOGOUT L'action réaliser ici est assez évidente, vous avez aussi la possibilité de vous déconnecter de CannabisRoad sur chaque page dans le coin en haut à droite  ET VOILA VOUS AVEZ CONFIGURE VOTRE COMPTE.  Vous pouvez maintenant commencer à rassemblez des bitcoins pour les achats que vous voudrez faire si vous n'en avez pas dejà quelques-uns en tête, cela peut prendre un peu de temps et en tant que nouvel acheteur cela prend souvent 1 ou 2 jours pour que votre compte soit validé avant que les BiTCoins ne soient transférés vers votre porte monnaie Cannabis Road.

[VPN if used (although the use of VPN is subject to debate and not vital), other programs using the internet closed, and Tor Network Settings tested  https://check.torproject.org/?lang=en_US ] :   1/ REGISTERING TO THE ROAD  Go the the  Cannabis Road url :  http://cannabiskofvl7pa.onion/ This will also be the URL you'll need to use to get to Cannabis Road to login later once you have created your account.  click on the link "" Create one here""at the bottom of the login window in the blue rectangle @  Don't have an account? Create one here. (links to  http://cannabiskofvl7pa.onion/register )    2/ Fill in all the information to REGISTER on the page  a)  Choose a username (really not wise to put your real nickname or the same username as on any clearnet (not Tor .onion) site you use - just in case Law Enforcement got a hand on anything anywhere)  b)  Choose a password and confirm it (here again don't use a password from the clearnet you use for anything else on the Darknet (.onion sites) as a precaution.  c)  CHOOSE A PIN from 4-10 digits. Re-type it below.  VERY VERY IMPORTANT DON'T FORGET OR LOSE YOUR PIN IT WOULD RESULT IN YOUR BITCOIN FUNDS BEING BLOCKED AND LOST FOR YOU! As generally with Bitcoin transactions one of the inconveniences is that many actions are irreversible and have no backup or recovery systems.  Basicaly without your PIN, your Account would be like a Debit Bank Card for which you lost the PIN code and for which you could never retrieve the PIN nor transfer the money from the bank account. Or if that wasn't clear: Without your PIN you're proper fucked, so hold on to it you all    d)  Choose Account Type: Buyer  e)  Type in the numbers from the  Captcha box in the box below  f) Tick the  Agree with Terms and Conditions box and hit the  Submit link below    3/ This should take you back to the LOGIN page at  http://cannabiskofvl7pa.onion/   Login using the username and password you used to register to the road.   Type in the numbers from the Captcha box in the box below ( it's NOT your PIN that you need to type here BUT the 4 lttle numbers in the grey background)  And hit the  SIGN IN link below.    4/ OFFICIALY WELCOME TO CANNABIS ROAD ACCOUNT PROFILE CONFIGURATION   You are now on the market homepage :)Welcome BUT First Things First.  You should  fill in your profile to get the best search results and the account safe and functional as follows:  a)  Click on the link MY ACCOUNT in the top right hand corner of the homepage below the "" Welcome USERNAME ""  Now you are on the  MY ACCOUNT Panel I'll explain the basic functionalities in each of the pages here:   *CHANGE PASSWORD / PIN. Title is quite obvious.  Password AND PIN are necessary to change either Password or PIN. Another Good reason to definitely not lose the PIN.   *MY SHOPPING CART  Where listings you've chosen to order will end up once you've selected the product, Shipping Option, Escrow Method etc... You'll come here to confirm your orders and proceed with payment (escrow) of your order and will be linked to the rest of the process where you place your address etc... This will be explained in a dedicated Tutorial On How to Place an Order shortly.   *MY PLACED ORDERS  Once you'll have ordered your past orders and many actions for feedback, fund release, package reception status will be. It'll be explained in the dedicated Place an Order Tutorial   *MY PGPA VERY VERY IMPORTANT FEATURE.I'll explain it to you in a dedicated Tutorial On How to Place an Order / PGP Encryption how to create a PGP Key and use an encryption program.  In the meantime I urge you  DO NOT PLACE AN ORDER without a PGP key and encryption program, but you can browse and put orders in your shopping cart in the meantime without risk.   In my opinion sending your shipment address to buy without PGP is like going to the brothel and not having a condom...  But you can walk around and just look and you won't catch any diseases, but if you decide to go for it anyways you're risking a lot of nasty diseases.  Might be you won't have any problems, but if you lose you'll bitterly regret it... And most sellers would not do business with you without it anyways (hey just like at the brothel I guess again).  If you already use PGP Encryption I suggest you create a new key for darknet activities if you don't already have a ""dark"" key. You then just need to  click the PGP Key link, copy the public part of the key and hit submit and there you go it's registered  If you didn't undesrtand a word of this paragraph wait for the tutorial and don't buy yet     *ACCOUNT SETTING    This is the part you want to fill in to make the browse comfortable for you around the road.   -COUNTRY : You probably think: Hell no, I won't tell the site... But the use of that information is  to enable the serch filters for domestic vendors and for vendors that send to your country.  So it does come in very handy to search the listings. And you can also Reset it to undisclosed just before you logout everytime so it doesn't stay stocked when your account opens if it makes you feel safer.   -CURRENCY: Choose if you want prices displayed in BTC Bitcoins directly of if you want to see the price in your currency using the exchange rates with USDollar EURos GBPounds CADollars AUDollars and  displaying the price in that currency.  Choose whatever suits you. Leaving BTC will display price in USD in large and in BTC in small (just like if you chose USD actually). Chosing any other Currency will display the chosen currency in large and the BTC price in small on the search pages.   Other useful information: In the bottom left hand side of all of the whole site pages, you'll find a quick exchange rate panel to the above currencies also which comes in quite handy.   -WELCOME PHRASE:Basic anti-phishing protection. Type any chosen phrase and submit and check that it does indeed appear in the top right hand corner just below the ""HELLO USERNAME"" line and above the"" MY ACCOUNT / LOGOUT"" line.  It should appear everytime you login. If it doesn't something is wrong check the URL, close everything recheck the URL, don't buy or withdraw/deposit BTC!!! and then only call the police to explain your cannabisroad account has probably been hacked/phished.   -TWO FACTOR AUTHENTIFICATION: Don't touch this yet if you don't know what this means or really understand PGP two factor encryption nor have inserted a PGP key. All this will be explained in the Tutorial dealing with PGP Encryption. This is  AN EXTRA SAFETY FEATURE which will provide an extra level of protection of your login, it uses your PGP key therefor making you less vulnerable to a hack of your account and having someone connect under your login (they would need your username, password, PIN, AND ALSO The PGP Private part of the Key + the PGP Key Passphrase), but not using it isn't barebacking in the brothel. Read about this in the other Tutorials.      *LOGOUT Well quite obvious what it does, you also have the possibility to logout on every page of the road in the top right hand corner.    THERE YOU GO YOU'VE SETUP YOUR ACCOUNT.   Now you can start gathering bitcoins for the purchases you'll want to buy if you don't already have some, this can be a bit time consuming and as new buyers it often takes 1-2 days for your account to be cleared before the BiTCoins transfer to your C Road Wallet.  Enjoy the ride around CannabisRoad.  ENJOY THE BROWSE AROUND THE SITE.",
Cannabis Road 2,8a592e39fd739dc5673ec10383caa37880e81ea0f40d151fbf5572c25a1a08fe,546.0,2014-08-06T09:00:12,Cannabis Highstory X,Cannabis Road Discussion/General Discussion," An amusing and relevant story  about my Uncle Tom, written by some guy idk.Tom Forcade,  <3  RIP /pw Heres Pie in Your Eye   Pieing for fun and profit.  I used to throw pies for a living.  The story usually elicits a good chuckle or two. Its the perfect gambit when dinner-party conversation lagsa legendary prank executed long ago in my rascal past, a kind of April Fools joke.  But what my audience never knows is this: theyre talking to a guy who once commanded a hit squad of domestic terrorists that carried out a slew of public attacks in broad daylight and got away with it.  Well, mostly. An enraged crowd of Trekkies nearly stomped me to death after Id boldly gone and pied William Shatner, their beloved Captain Kirk, at a Star Trek convention. But Im getting ahead of myself. While I abhor pointless violence, I have long believed there are some people in this world who deserve to be smacked in the face with a pie. Vladimir Putin, for example, or my girlfriends ex-husbandanyone for whom a well-aimed pie could serve as a rebuke and a corrective measure.  The legal code may define it as a violent actwhen comedian Jonnie Marbles pied Rupert Murdoch, he earned jail time for assaultbut to my mind, what motivates the striking thrust is not violence but idealism. Che Guevara once said, The true revolutionary is guided by great feelings of love. I say the tarts trajectory is often guided by faith in humanityor at least a sense of humor.  Popular belief has it that the pie-in-the-face gag (a word derived from the Norse gagg, meaning yelp) originated in the silent-movie era. Performed by the slapstick director Mack Sennetts Keystone Kops, Fatty Arbuckle, Laurel and Hardy, the Three Stooges, and various imitators then and since, the stunt seems uniquely American. What better enforcer of the democratic dogma than a tossed pie? A gooey face is an instant social equalizer.  Of course, the self-important have always been targets for a takedown; even if pieing is a predominantly American phenomenon, the puncturing of pomposity is universal. Im reminded of certain graffiti left behind in Egyptian tombs by workers who remarked on the pharaohs resemblance to the buttocks of an ox.  The French have a word for it, of course: lèse-majesté, injured sovereignty, an ancient crime from the Roman era, still on the books in such countries as Turkey and Thailand. Even in the Netherlands, a man was jailed in 2012 for calling Queen Beatrix a con woman and a sinner, and demanding abolishment of the monarchy. Royalty has always deserved, short of the guillotine, the pie.  The first incidence of political pie-throwing occurred in 1970, when politics overshadowed everything. Nixon ruled, the Vietnam War dragged on, and the previous decades legacy of political assassinations carried over into a new decade of surliness and pugnacity. In the early days of May, antiwar protesters filled the streets and the National Guard shot four students dead on the Kent State University campus.  Capitol Hill on May 13, 1970, was not in a joking mood. Thomas King Forcade, head of the Underground Press Syndicate, was testifying before a meeting of the Presidents Commission on Obscenity and Pornography, originally convened by Lyndon B. Johnson. Forcade cited forty-five publications around the country shut down or persecuted by authorities on charges of obscenity. He concluded his testimony with the cry, The only obscenity is censorship! Then he drew a cream pie hed somehow smuggled in his briefcase and launched it accurately into the face of commission chairman Otto N. Larsen, the head of the University of Washingtons sociology department. Wire services carried the photo worldwide.  Forcades epic pie-toss was the first known instance of pastry as a political weapon. Nothing less than domestic terrorism à la mode, it was a kind of violence that inflicted smiles: Abbie Hoffman and the Yippies scattering money on the floor of the Stock Exchange; an armed, uniformed squad of Vietnam Veterans Against the War roughing up tourists in the U.S. Capitol and threatening to add to their body count. Guerilla Theater, we used to call this tomfoolery, and as the original Boston Tea Party did, it helped fire up a revolution.  Forcade was a buddy of mine. We conspired on a wide range of joint ventures, so to speak, involving pot, publishing, politics, and mayhem, including the creation of High Times magazine. An unusual intellect as well as a pioneer of Colombian imports, Forcade was an avid fan of the sci-fi genre. One of his favorite novels was Agents of Chaos.  Written by Norman Spinrad, Agents of Chaos posits a naive revolutionary group sometime in the distant future; they fight the Hegemony to bring democracy to the solar system. But the rebels and rulers contend with a third force, the unpredictable Brotherhood of Assassinsaka the Agents of Chaos. Fearless, cultish followers of the philosopher Gregor Markowitz, the Agents are guided by his Theory of Social Entropy. Every Social Conflict, according to Markowitz, is the arena for three mutually antagonistic forces: the Establishment, the anti-Establishment, and Chaosthe pervasive tendency for everything to screw up.  Forcade was on the side of the screw-ups. He saw Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, left and right, as part and parcel of the same Establishment; he wanted to be the Third Force, subverting the whole shebang. In Agents of Chaos he found his guiding principle, and, aided by illicit pharmacopeia and a manic-depressive condition, he acted it out. As a result, he was shunned by the left, hounded by the FBI, and frequently irritating to his closest friends.  Goaded by the political zeitgeist, I was determined to create my own Agents of Chaos, a cadre of trusted comrades who could be called upon to rise up and act decisively, who would know how to infiltrate difficult locations, carry out a plan of action, and escape into the night. Partisans to fight off Nixons gestapo after Tricky Dicks inevitable coup detat! But clandestine groups required too much secretive energy. Instead, I decided, we would train openly, using pies as a front.  Taking a businesslike approach, we created a brochure offering a menu of attacks: Squirt Gun Ambush, Seltzer Bottle Blitz, and the classic Pie-in-the-Face, with a choice of flavors (chocolate cream, lemon meringue, etc.). Fees began at a basic $150, with upward adjustments depending upon the difficulty involved. Their anonymity guaranteed, customers signed a contract authorizing the hit. Payment was 50 percent up front, with the remainder, plus expenses, due on the successful conclusion of the mission. For an extra fee we provided photographic evidence. A small advertisement in the Village Voice got us started; a bit of PR pulled a mention from Voice columnist Howard Smith. Agents of Pie-Kill took off.  REX & DAVID FROST - PIE-KILL David Frost getting pied on live TV. Thats me with the big fro. The woman next to me is the actress Adrienne Barbeau. I pied her. At first, our ranks counted two: me and my then-girlfriend. Call her Agile Accomplice. Shes the one in thigh-high leather boots who jumped out of a taxicab in front of the Buffalo Roadhouse patio, just off Sheridan Square, waving a couple of water-filled pistols, dousing a clients cheating boyfriend. (He was dining al fresco with his new sweetie.) It was she who shoved a cream pie in David Frosts face on live network television, a hit contracted by the shows producer. She possessed a certain pie panache.  When business demanded more agents, our first recruit was a sturdy young man named Aron Kay. He was a Brooklyn-born disciple of A. J. Weberman, the so-called Garbologist, infamous for digging through Bob Dylans trash. Kay used to act as a sort of bodyguard for Webermanhis awesome girth and bulk were perfect for fending off Webermans critics, mainly fanatical Dylan fans. I taught our willing cadet the proper procedures: reconnoitering the location, surveilling the target, rehearsing the moves and plotting alternate escape routes. Within days of joining Pie-Kill, he was in the field, armed and dangerousas long as he didnt eat the pies.  At its peak, Agents of Pie-Kills roster numbered half a dozen agents. We pulled in a fair amount of cash revenue and inspired imitators worldwide. Time called us the biggest fad since streaking. Every day the news would report someone somewhere getting a pie in the face. Our own Agent Kay scored headline-making hits against the conservative pundit William F. Buckley and antifeminist Phyllis Schlafly.  Things got out of hand when Pat Halley, a Detroit affiliate acting pro bono, smacked a pie into the kisser of the fifteen-year-old self-proclaimed Perfect Master Guru Maharaj Ji. As reported by Walter Cronkite on national news and around the world, God had been hit in the face with a shaving-cream pie! The Gurus acolytes retaliated, putting Halley in the hospital with fifty-five stitches and a permanent plastic plate in his skull.  It wasnt long before we noticed Agent Kay had switched to autopilot. He couldnt stop throwing pies at people: Watergate operative Gordon Liddy, New York City mayor Abe Beame, Senator Daniel Moynihan, and even rock poet Patti Smith. The list goes on. Agents of Pie-Kill had created a monster. And suddenly, the times were a-changin once again: Nixon was gone, the war was over, and a peanut farmer was president. Time to close the patisserie.  The subversion of our radical agendato what was, at best, a lighter moment on the evening news, and, at worst, a business model for the service industrywas politically pathetic, its true. But theres no success like failure, as Dylan says, capturing the ambivalence of the postsixties era, and failures no success at all. So it goes on. In the wilds of Canada, Les Entartistes, a Canadian bunch specializing in politicians and financiers, was still tossing tarts into the late 1990s. More recently, Confeiteiros sem Fronteiras has been active in Brazil, lobbing pies at rich rainforest despoilers. The pitcher A. J. Burnett, during the Yankees 2009 season, deflated scoring teammates with pies in the face as they touched home plate. Lucy Liu and Jimmy Fallon mutually pied each other last year on late-night TV.  My own exploits would fill volumes. The full story awaits scholarly research in the Pie-Kill Archives, recently acquired by Yales Beinecke Library. I will probably never launch a pie again. Nor will my former associates: Agile Accomplice has gone off to pursue targets with a sharpened pen. My cadre has withered awayexcept for Aron Kay, who, at sixty-three, weighs a reported 366 pounds. He is too well recognized to wield a pie effectively, and is under doctors orders not to consume any more of them.  The terrible truth is that far more serious agents of chaos have run the surprise-attack business into the ground. Things are so tight now you couldnt fling a cupcake without running afoul of Homeland Security or Moms Against Bullying. On some level, the prankster has been prankedthe jokes on us. As a veteran mischief-maker, I would say that April Fools Day in America is over.  But then again, you never know.   *ClearNet* http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2014/04/01/heres-pie-in-your-eye/",

Look for the constellation Orion. Orion's belt are the three bright stars in a row. Follow an imaginary line through the three stars to Sirius which is just above the horizon. It is bluish in color.  With a visual apparent magnitude  of −1.46, it is almost twice as bright as Canopus, the next brightest star. The name ""Sirius"" is derived from the Ancient Greek Σείριος Seirios (""scorcher""). What the naked eye perceives as a single star is actually a binary star system, consisting of a white main sequence star of spectral type A1V, termed Sirius A, and a faint white dwarf companion of spectral type DA2, termed Sirius B. The distance separating Sirius A from its companion varies between 8.1 and 31.5 AU. Sirius appears bright because of both its intrinsic lumosity and its proximity to Earth. Sirius is also known colloquially as the ""Dog Star"", reflecting its prominence in its constellation, Canis Major (Big Dog). The heliacal rising of Sirius marked the flooding of the Nile in Ancient Egypt and the ""Dog days"" of summer for the Ancient Greeks, while to the Polynesians it marked winter and was an important star for navigation around the Pacific Ocean.  Sirius was the most important star in the sky to the ancient Egyptians. The ancient Egyptian calendar was based on the rising of Sirius. It is established for certain that Sirius was sometimes identified by the ancient Egyptians with their chief goddess Isis. Sirius was astronomically the foundation of the Egyptian religious system. It was the embodiment of Isis , wife and consort of the god Osiris, who appeared in the sky as Orion .  'The Dog Star' is a common designation of Sirius throughout known history. The ancient god Anubis was a 'dog god', that is, he had a man's body and a dog's head.    History  A greek traveler and chronicler by the name of Herodotus visited the cannabis loving tribe during a year long cannabis festival they hold every fifty years. Explaining the celebration the Dogons pointed to the brightest star in the winter sky and said it was the ""Two Dog Star"". Cannabis is a greek word though its origins are african that translates to ""Two Dog"" and Two Dog Star was the home of the Two Dog Plant. (Cannabis) The year long celebration was in honor of that star and the medicinal herb that was brought to them. Canis is Latin for ""dog"". Canine - dog . -   latin . Two dog - 2 stars . Sirius A and Sirius B  Historian Robert Temple reported extraterrestrials may even have rocked the cradle of civilization in his bestseller,The Sirius Mystery. Starting with a French anthropological study of the Dogon tribe in Mali, Temple unraveled a bizarre tale that connected the diverse cultures of Nubia, Egypt, Mesopotamia and Greece to the Sirius star cluster. Temple believes a certain watery planet attached to the white dwarf star, Sirius B, is home to an alien race that once visited Earth. From the Dogon, he learned that Sirius B orbits the much larger Sirius A, and that there's a miniscule Sirius C nearby. The three stars are about 8,000 light years away and only Sirius A is visible with the naked eye. How the Dogon came by their astronomical data is unclear, especially given that Sirius C wasn't discovered by modern astronomers until the 1990s. The Dogon and other nearby tribes believe that a planet circling Sirius B is home to a race of intelligent but amphibious beings who visited Earth in remote times. Curiously, some of the biggest names in world mythology  including Enki in Babylonia, Oannes in Sumeria, Osiris and Thoth in ancient Egypt, and Viracocha in South America  are all remembered as being fish-like or fish-garbed in appearance.  One of the best-known ancient sources of the alleged alien visitation is the Chaldean historian Berossus. In the third century B.C. he wrote a detailed description of the Babylonian ""god"" Oannes compiled from his own research of much older accounts: ""The whole body of this being was like that of a fish; and under a fish's head another head, and also feet below, similar to those of a man, subjoined to the fish's tail...When the sun set, it was the custom of this Being to plunge again into the sea, and abide all night in the deep...""    Myth & Legend  In Mali, West Africa, lives a tribe of people called the Dogon. The Dogon are believed to be of Egyptian decent and their astronomical lore goes back thousands of years to 3200 BC. According to their traditions, the star Sirius has a companion star which is invisible to the human eye. This companion star has a 50 year elliptical orbit around the visible Sirius and is extremely heavy. It also rotates on its axis.  This legend might be of little interest to anybody but the two French anthropologists, Marcel Griaule and Germain Dieterlen, who recorded it from four Dogon priests in the 1930's. Of little interest except that it is exactly true. How did a people who lacked any kind of astronomical devices know so much about an invisible star? The star, which scientists call Sirius B, wasn't even photographed until it was done by a large telescope in 1970.  The legend goes on to say the Nommos also furnished the Dogon's with some interesting information about our own solar system: That the planet Jupiter has four major moons, that Saturn has rings and that the planets orbit the sun. These were all facts discovered by Westerners only after Galileo invented the telescope.  The story of the Dogon and their legend was first brought to popular attention by Robert K.G. Temple in a book published in 1977 called The Sirius Mystery. Science writer Ian Ridpath and astronomer Carl Sagan made a reply to Temple's book, suggesting that this modern knowledge about Sirius must have come from Westerners who discussed astronomy with the Dogon priests. The priests then included this new information into the older traditions. This, in turn, mislead the anthropologists.  This is a possibility considering Sirius B's existence was suspected as early as 1844 and seen was through a telescope in 1862. It doesn't seem to explain a 400-year old Dogon artifact that apparently depicts the Sirius configuration nor the ceremonies held by the Dogon since the 13th century to celebrate the cycle of Sirius A and B. It also doesn't explain how the Dogons knew about the super-density of Sirius B, a fact only discovered a few years before the anthropologists recorded the Dogon stories.    The Dagon Tribe believes that the starting point of creation is a star that revolves around Sirius and is known as the "" Digitaria star "" . Their understanding is that this star is small , but heavy , and contains the building elements of creation . (  With a mass nearly equal to the Sun's, Sirius B is one of the more massive white dwarfs known ,  Our solar system is born in from the womb of Isis. Sirius B, which is Isis , is made of iron (radio astronomy has shown). The iron of Sirius b, is the same as the iron in our blood and the iron of Earth and of our solar system. Sirius is our blood. We resonate to her. She is older than our solar system, which is a combination of interstellar debris, including the gas clouds, our sperm of Osiris/Orion. The iron in our blood comes from Sirius, its position in the sky, could thus be considered to resonate to Sirius's position of influence. Iron is the only true magnetic element. Sirius has a unique relationship to us.  )   Two French anthropologists Marcel Griaule  and Germaine Dieterlen studied the Dagon tribe that live in an isolated mountainous region of Bandiagara , south of the Sahara Desert in Mali , West Africa . Mr. Griaule wrote about thir discoveries of the Dgon tribe in his book , "" Conversations with Ogotemmeli "" , published in 1947 .  Ogotemmeli was the tribes oral historian as was his father before him . He states that we were created by beings that genetically engineered  our DNA . In fact , he said that our DNA was manipulated three times and that three different versions of humans were designed . This was due to foiled experiments by our creators . Amphibious aliens from the Sirian star system , that landed on earth with "" great noise and wind "" . These aliens combined their DNA with the DNA of a single sexed animals - us .   ( Genesis  1:27     ""  God created man in His own image , in the image of God He created him ""  )  That's right , this isolated African tribe have an oral history that claims Mankind was genetically seeded by a race of aliens called the Nummos and that this race of space -aliens came from the star system that only now , with advances in science and orbiting telescopes , can finally confirm the beliefs of a African tribe that originally migrated from Egypt .  So the big question is or should be , "" How can an isolated tribe , a people with no written history , have scientific information concerning stars light years away that astronomers are just confirming today ? ""  Although , their places of origin seem to defer , there are amazing similarities between the Nummo and the Annunaki who came to earth and settled Sumer .",

At once a marijuana smuggler, weed dealer, renegade publisher, political activist, and cosmic prankster, Forcade came of age hot-rodding in his native Arizona, often having occasion to outrace the local police in the famed Bonneville Salt Flats. From his high-octane teenage years until his death in 1978 at age 33, the young outlaw from the wild West always felt most comfortable one step ahead of the law. In addition to being bold, Tom Forcade was also brilliant, graduating from the University of Utah's business administration program in just two-and-a-half years. Given his anti-establishment leanings, the choice of such a seemingly square college major reveals Forcade's approach to revolution as a serious endeavor, requiring commitment, strategy, and plenty of money. But whether he was flying in a multi-ton shipment of Santa Marta Gold from Colombia or launching a national magazine in praise of America's last taboo pleasure, the profit potential of each mission was always secondary to the thrill of adventure and the opportunity to support his favorite causes. Along with leaving $10,000 in cashHigh Times founder Tom Forcadeon the doorstep of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) with an anonymous note encouraging other marijuana dealers to do the same, he also helped form the Rock Liberation Front to shake down major rock music promoters and make them donate a portion of their profits back to the emerging youth culture that had made them rich in the first place.

Our second session was at around 8PM with Orange Kush from zeltasgarden.  My dad didn't take many hits, because he was worried that he would get that uneasy feeling again and not be able to get up during the night if he needed to do anything.  The pain relief lasted about an hour.  Overall, I think his experience with the pain relief effects were positive.  We believe that having less of a dose of the Blue Dream may help with the dizziness issue.  Next time we will probably have him start slower with less hits and wait about 10-20 minutes to see if the pain relief is there without the dizziness.  My dad also expressed a concern about continually having to vape during the day, if the effects only last about 2 hours.  I basically told him that it may be necessary to try different strains in order to find one that lasts longer for him.

As far as vaping/smoking, I think the longest relief that can be expected is going to be 2-3 hours before another dose is needed.  As he uses more, I think that time window will shrink and it'll take more to get him to the same point.  Essentially, His tolerance will continue to raise.  With well timed and sized doses I think that may be manageable, but that would be up to your father.  I think it's better than popping opiates and dealing with all the side effects that come with it.  Pain management isn't fun.  I get to assist my wife in this manner too.  For longer term relief I think you may have to look into tinctures,edibles, capsules.  This opens up a whole can of worms and really can begin to get complicated as far as making, dosing, timing.  When doing so you have to be very consistent in just about every step or your dad will be in for a few surprising rides.  Everything from his own digestion 'motility', diet, extraction methods, temperatures, to who knows what else can greatly impact the outcome here.  I think you are on the right track for now.  Find out which strain works well first and then you (we all) can help address the other options.",

Keep cracking those eggs of knowledge on us!","I've been researching the terpenes a lot and I think the key with ""Blue-"" strains and pain management is the linalool content at about 2%. I'm looking through a database of a place that tests for dispensaries to see what terpenes are in which. Linalool is most notable as the characteristic smell of lavender but it has application in a lot of fruity flavors too. One person described her first experience smelling it as like Fruit Loops. There's also a patent for a blueberry flavor that is a blend 1:1 of linalool and cis-3-hexanol (very common green, fresh mowed grass flavor).Linalool is known to help pain and also be a sedative on its own."

Especially those with limited experience and medical issues, it is always best to go as gently as possible. Easy vaping with an arizer or magic flight launch box is a good way to start, as opposed to getting an oil rig and doing shatter dabs on day one, for example.   A good old fashioned doobie is also a great choice, as it gives you a controlled dose, and it requires no specialized equipment or potential for hazard.  My personal experience with the blue dream has been mixed. A lot of it I have tried has been pretty underwhelming to be honest. It wasn't until recently has this strain's true potential been revealed, because of the way the cannabis was cared for, from seed to my door.  That is why, as a medical cannabis user, I find it useful to find smaller scale vendors who either work very closely with the grower, or are the grower themselves. I also like vendors who are notoriously helpful and can communicate well like Ava and Jack. TheBestCannabis is another one who fits this criteria. That is the main reason why these forums are so valuable to me. Those characteristics are easier to detect than from just a profile page, when you read a person's posts and have an opportunity to have a dialog.  There is potential to develop a relationship - to the extent this medium allows - with the people who produce my meds. It allows me to ask questions and get informed honest answers about the specific cultivar, that don't come from leafly marketing blurbs and opinion of strangers.   That is my preference, as opposed to working with a reseller, or a large operation where there is often a disconnect between the people who are making the product and the people who are representing the product.   Larger ops also tend to communicate less it seems...cost of doing big biz perhaps.  ",

The closest thing we currently offer to the Blue Dream is our ""Big Lebowski"", which is Blueberry crossed with Cinderella99 pineapple pheno.  The C99 pineapple is a very sweet and gentle sativa so it gives the cross a very mellow, happy and relaxing high.  He might do better for daytime use with something like Blue Dream.  Something I'd add is that its a good idea to expose him to a variety of strains as everyone has somewhat different physiology and will react differently from each other, so to some extent trial and error is a must.    Also, I'll repeat what @spicoli said that all phenotypes are not the same, and add that good genetics is important but just as important is care in growing.  Use of quality nutrients, organics and avoidance of pesticides all have substantial impacts on the quality of the meds.  The good news is there are a good number of knowledgeable and skilled growers and suppliers here to choose from.  Finally, getting off opiates is not an easy affair.  He's doing the right thing by weening off them slowly and I'd just add that marijuana can be a very useful aid to that process, especially the indicas or indica-dominant hybrids.  A little couch lock may be a small price to pay for avoiding the worst of opiate withdrawal symptoms.  In any event, good luck, you've come to the right place  .",

My dad has no tolerance. He's only vaped with me once, and it was a mid-grade purple haze.  He took about 3 hits and he seemed to do well.  He felt his pain melt away for about an hour.  I'm from the U.S. and right now I'm probably going to stick with domestic unless I'm convinced otherwise that international is safe enough.  Right now he is mostly interested in daytime relief, as most of his pain is movement related.  He does sometimes have difficulty sleeping, so I may want to get him some night time relief as well down the road, if he seems to do well on his own with daytime meds.   I've added AngelEyes to my favs, and will definitely keep her in mind.  I was looking at her stuff, but she seems to have ran out of stock at the moment.  Another vendor I was looking into was CGC for the Blue Dream.   I have been doing a lot of browsing on leafly, and really like their information.  It does help to read the reviews on there, especially with respect to how strains help people with specific conditions in regards to pain relief.  All in all, I believe that anything that provides a nice body-numbing high will be great for him and will be infinitely better than being a slave to those narcotics that doctors seem to prescribe freely for any little pain.  That just makes me so mad sometimes to think that such addictive and potentially dangerous medicines such as these narcotics are fine with lawmakers, but a wonderful non-addictive medicinal plant is held from the patients that really need it.  Thanks again for all your help!","Does your Dad have any tolerance?  What continent are you located and are you willing to order from elsewhere?   I know it is primarily for pain, but does he need help getting to sleep?  If so, I might recommend 2 different strains.  ;For pain, I'd recommend a lighter sativa (especially if low tolerance, and go easy.  At least I get panic or anxiety feelings if I have too much or it is just too strong).   AngelEyes (vendor here) is a pleasure to work with and if you contact her outside of the order she will give you good recommendations.  I've tried a variety of hers and am very pleased with everything.;I'd also recommend leafly.com and see if you can find specific traits.  It's a good guide but I've found it's not *the bible*."

I don't have any pics of Nordle at the moment, but I do have a plant that just went into bloom so I'll try to get some pics along the way.  She's a very vigorous growing strain with many indica traits in the garden.  I'd describe the smell as very earthy with some sweet fruit in there and very smooth smoke.  I can't claim much knowledge on terpene-pain correlation, but I can tell you that many of my medical customers are exceptionally pleased with it.  I started it for a cancer customer that wanted to make oil from it, but I've of course shared it with several customers and everyone has enjoyed it.  One customer with severe back pain says it provides better, longer lasting pain relief than other strains.  I have an indirect MS customer that I hear loves it for symptom relief.  The thing that's very interesting to me is that I expected it to be good for pain relief and therefore would have a body stone, but it seems to have a pretty strong head high too for many people.  I know the THC is supposed to be low and balanced with the CBD, but the high that many people get makes me wonder if the phenotype I got might also be high in THC.  I haven't had it lab tested, so I can't say for certain.  I have one customer that suffers from PTSD and said the effects were all over the board for him.  One time he would feel very little effect and the next we would be buried deep in the couch.  It seems to be an interesting beast and probably worth a try for most and certainly anyone looking for pain relief.  --TBF","Looks good with really competitive pricing. You are on my short list for my next order but it will probably be a while. I don't see the Northern Lights up yet. The plentiful trichs on the GodBud looks really nice to me, big fan of indicas here.Could you describe the smell and/or possibly take some pictures of the Nordle growing sometime? I have been doing some research on terpenes (you can read here in the mango thread in research forum). A place called Analytical360 posts results of terpene profiles publicly, so I am slowly learning what terpenes are in different strains. A lot of the high CBD buds are quite lacking in terpenes, especially linalool and beta-caryophyllene which should be best for pain. There is one test result for Nordle though and it has a high linalool content, so it may be extra good for people who smoke for pain issues."

Definitely snap some pics of the buds if you can eventually. Linalool is the characteristic aroma molecule of lavender, but it has tea/citrus/rose/fruity nuances to it. A lot of the blue/purple strains have linalool. Linalool on its own has sedative effects, anti-anxiety and relieves pain, so it really should be just that much better for pain than some other CBD buds that lack it.  The results I saw had almost no THC, so I am not sure about the head high though. Seems like most CBD buds will be very low THC and near 20% CBD, or else something like 3-5% THC/8-15% CBD. It seems like both THC and CBD benefit PTSD. PTSD sufferers have low serum levels of anandamide (the natural endo-cannabinoid in the body that acts on CB1 receptors same as THC). CBD and beta-caryophyllene (BCP) work on CB2 receptors and also counteracts some of the paranoia from THC. Maybe have your PTSD patient try Nordle + some citrusy strain with THC, Cali Orange perhaps.  The couch-lock comes from a different terpene called myrcene that potentiates with THC on CB1 receptors. Another lemony terpene, alpha-terpineol, does this too. It is hard without analysis to tell if a ""lemon"" strain has limonene or alpha-terpineol. Limonene will be more like sweet citrus oranges and lemons and the terpineol more like old lemon rind. I think limonene will be better for your PTSD guy but getting him both THC and CBD sounds more important.",

Even the lowest quality bud will be stinky through crumpled aluminum foil + newspapers. Standard vacuum bags would work 100x better then the foil newspaper set up. If you triple up on the vacuum bags you would get a decent seal. I also recommend you do not talk about your shipping methods on a public forum. This has a disaster written all over it.  Food grade PE is not that great but we used it for about our first 25 orders(due to naivety and thinking 4 layers would be okay) none got seized(luckily). Scents did not leak but it is still not safe. Now that you know it is your responsibility to not compromise your buyers. I hope all your packages arrive safely and make sure you make the best decision for the person receiving the item. They may be a two strike offender and something silly like putting there 12g of weed in aluminum foil can send them to jail for 25 years.  Edit: I see he is already no longer a vendor. Hopefully everyone gets there goodies!,"Hey everyone, I'd like to apologize for a big fuck up on my part.  I'd sent stuff using vacuum sealed bags before plenty of times and never had any issues, so I assumed it would work.  I switched up to high quality stuff when I became a vendor, it smelled a lot stronger, and it started to smell a few hours after it was left at the post office, so the packages got seized at the post office here.  I'm not trying to scam anyone - I'm giving refunds to anyone that wants to cancel their order - I just made a big mistake.  I'm shipping orders now wrapped in multiple layers of aluminum foil, padded with newspaper so it feels like paper inside.  I'm working on getting MBBs, but they're difficult to source here."

Stealth: 9.9/10  (see below)  Weed: 10/10  (Fits the description, and was what I expected)   Shipping: 9/10   (6 days in EU. Could be faster options, this was fine)   Communication: 10/10   (Jessie responded to private messages promptly, and has been posting on the forums too)  I agree totally about the stealth, it's clear that a lot of attention was put into the detail. I won't speak about specifics, but, seriously, this is some damn fine stealth right here. Jessie seems to have done everything correctly, going above the standard that a lot of vendors use. The only other aspect that I can't speak of is whether it ever changes, as I have only the one package to go by.   The weed itself is consistent with the descriptions I've seen of Northern Lights #5 as a hybrid strain. The Buds look cared for, big, properly cured and fluffly (as ford mentioned, this is a bit rare). It seems to be overweight, but I don't have the scales to verify that.   This weed seems really good for a 'calming' effect, and would probably be good for pain relief in larger amounts. The weed produces a decent amount of vapor, which suggests that it has been well cared for. I haven't had the chance to take a huge lungful yet, but I imagine I'd have difficulty typing out a review if I did. ",

Since following his operation on another market for a while, and consistently missing out on listings due to poor planning and bad timing, it was a pleasure to see TheBudFather come home to Cannabis Road.   Communication -  This vendors communication has always been friendly and professional, and his speedy and thoughtful responses to questions, and accommodation of requests, place TheBudFather firmly at the top of my favorite vendor list, and his consistent service will keep his name there as long as he decides to vend here.   Stealth - Perfect, beyond industry standard and packed with care. TBF has you covered. No smell until 3 layers in, and nothing unusual about box. Appearance, Potency, and Effects - Dense bright green, red haried trich covered nugs of delight of various sizes, perfectly trimmed with no shake. The God Bud was well cured with a slighly springy feel to the buds. The emanated  a citrusey kush scent and were sparkling with crystals. Something about smoking the God Bud that gets down deep in my soul, and spreads euphoria thru my head, with full face involvement, leaving a faint buzzing vibration behind after every hit.  But the body feeling like a warm blanket of comfort that is literally all good. Not much couch lock involved for us, just sweet chillaxation. Any worries or aches melted away on a sea of happy cannabination. This is a great one for those anxious moments or moderate pain relief.  Get some of the God Bud, you won't regret it!    Overall Score - 5/5 +++   Personal notes -  We already have a couple transactions between us, and from trim deals to big sexy nugs, TheBudFather is a pro level vendor, and a great asset to Cannabis Road.   His products are one of the best values on the darknet; someone safe to FE with, knowing your order will be delivered on time, and on point.   If you haven't had a look, you might want to do that now:  TBF Product Listings He doesn't stay stocked for long!        *edit> ...just checked, God Bud is out of stock..sux for you     ...but i hear the sour diesel is awesome and know for a fact the hindu kush is frakkin righteous!",

I got the majority of Godbud based on his recommendation .Fruity taste of berries and nice large,frosty buds.Nice daytime indica buzz.The Northern Lights is Dank too with a very sugary sweet taste and very hybrid feeling high to me.Starts in the head and works its way to your body.I'm torn between which I will order next as I liked both of these VERY much!Pretty buds.The HK was my least favorite .Not that it wasn't good, just not my cup of tea.I just don't really don't care for earthy tasting weed ,and knew what to expect going in ,but I still had to try it since he was willing to make me a sampler.    Great experience and product . I will be a return customer. Thanks TBF!!!!!!!!!!!      ",

I ordered both LSD and Mango Kush. Shipping speed - 5/5 super fast.  I think i had it in about 2 days.  3 tops. communication 5/5 - none needed.  I ordered, it was marked shipped and I had it. Stealth - 4.75+/5.  No smell, sealed well and as to be expected.  Since it has been a little while I don't remember the specifics but there wasn't much visual barrier other than the MBB, vac pac, etc.  This is the only reason for not having a 5 here.  I've had other vendors take the stealth up a notch...those are the only 5 I'll give. Product - 6+/5.  Holy crap.  Once you open it you will be floored by the smell.  talk about mouth watering.  both products were/are great  Mango Kush - nice bag appeal.  great looks (trim and the bud itself), great smell.  great taste, moisture just about right.  Lovely high.  GREAT VALUE.  This looks and smokes better than most of its price range.  I really like the flavor and high that this one does. LSD - sticky.  Very sticky.  smells and looks great.  I mostly vape and can control my temps so I can really milk out the different flavors.  on inhale it wasn't much, but exhale and you get the lemon/citrus out of it early on and lower temps.  Once you've been on it for a little bit or have gotten to higher temps the diesel kick hits you.   You KNOW it is Lemony Sour and Diesel!  First few times I was scared of the potency reported by others(I'm a new user, lower tolerance but I do nightly sessions and sometimes a hit or two during the day) and never really hit super hard.  That changed one night when I said ""what the hell, let's do this"".   I vaped 2 bowls and started off disappointed (my fault, not ECCs.  I seem to have delayed onset sometimes).   I was going to share a bowl and then it fucking hit me.  I didn't need any more.  The body high started off a bit rough for me.  Other bud always seemed to hit me a bit like laughing gas at the dentist.  Gas is a nice warm buzzy feeling - like you have a warm blanket on you.  They never progressed much past that.  LSD, it went past that.  The body high i could only describe at the time like i was sandpaper.  It made sense to me then  .  On to the mind high.. HOLY MOLY, I hit a 10 or maybe even higher.  It started off with the giggles a bit.  then i couldn't stop.  I was doubling over laughing so hard that i felt like i had an ab workout the next morning.  And then...everything went cartoonish.  Everything I saw seemed to be drawn and colored by hand like the cartoons you used to watch when you were a kid.  It lasted until I passed out  .  I'm still in awe of that experience.  I've stated that I may be a 'noob' when it comes to weed, however I can say I've tried quite a few different strains in my short time using.  ECC's are up there in the top of the list.  Probably the top.  Even though I reviewed more of the LSD than the Mango, I actually like the Mango better because of the flavor.  Don't get me wrong, I love them both.  I keep the LSD for 'special sessions'.  ECC is on my very short list of vendors that I trust will send the product, live up to the reviews, and heck, even live up to the hype.   I will order from him again when I get thru my stock.  It may take a little bit though, Cannabis Road has so many vendors with great reputations on both product and service that I want to try.  Hell, I barely look at other markets now.",

My name is Don Cannabis, and I will be the Administrator running things around here. For those of you who were aware of the previous shortcomings involving Cannabis Road's initial launch, it was taken down in about 7 days after being exploited and having the database compromised.   No doubt, this was due to the fact that Cannabis Road wasn't ready for launch. It hadn't undergone a proper security audit, and was rushed without proper precautions being taken. We are aware of the SQL injection holes, we are aware of many other holes that may or may not have been discovered, and have taken them all very seriously and they have all been corrected and are currently undergoing rigorous security testing to make sure that no user's information can be compromised.   Passwords will not be stored in plain text, they will be encrypted with salts. All user input will be sanitized and in many cases white-listed. And never again will security be taken so lightly by our team. We are so thankful for the number of people who offered us a helping hand in response to our short lived launch, many of which did not even ask for compensation.   With that being said, if you do discover any security holes, please report them to our moderator and head of our development team  Crypto. You and Crypto can discuss  compensation for your discoveries.   Crypto is a new addition to our team, and has been brought aboard to help us stay secure moving forward.

I just took a look at the blockchain and it now seems to have been removed from that wallet.  The new wallet has received 9+ BTC total from many addresses and removed them all within 1 transaction that looks like into a blender.   That doesn't look promising at all.  One thing I've heard is that people have been successful in either spoof sites or malware getting installed where it watches for BTC addresses and then modifies on submit.  Essentially, you think you enter in an address, but on the confirmation of sending the site or your browser changes the address.  Being Tails and FF, I'm having a hard time believing it at this point.  However, we don't know all the steps, the exact sites, or even the full environment that the user had.    disillusion, where did you get the original link from?  from a list, from reddit, from a wiki somewhere?

It has been sitting there for 3 days which makes me believe it is most likely a misfire on the address the coins were sent to and will probably sit there forever. As to speculate CR has way bigger accounts to steal from then .35btc as users make larger purchases then that daily.  That being said they would not ruin their reputation for .35 bitcoins they would steal all of the funds when they wanted to instead of taking $200 and losing credibility and the ability to steal more. So check all of your bases where did you get that address are you sure it was ever your CR address and how have you accessed the marketplace(only use the marketplace link on the forum).   Hopefully you realize where the mistake was made and it never happens again we have sent coins to the wrong address/spoof site/account credentials we accidentally deleted. I find those three reasons are the cause of most lost coins.,

I created another support ticket on your behalf to test response time and to make sure the system was operational. Since this was my 3rd support issue since joining CR, the ticket was #3.  2. It is reasonable in any support situation, clearnet or dark, to give at least 3 business days for a response. I am aware that in this situation we are talking about large amounts of money and illegal drugs, so the stress level is higher than say, an amazon purchase. It is also a weekend, and appropriate weekend schedules may apply. SO..doing the math, I probably wouldn't expect to hear anything until Monday afternoon at the earliest.  3. I didn't see anywhere that shows confirmations on CR wallet page. Maybe you are thinking of another market's wallet page?  Blockchain.info? As long as you have the address you sent the btc to, and that address is on your cr wallet, I think everything is gonna be o.k.   4.

Taste: Smooth, sweet fruity inhale with a slight earthy undertone in the exhale. Delicious!!!  Effects: The fuck just happened? For real I feel like I just lost the game. Damn I love this strain. Everything you see is beautiful. Everything you think is beautiful. Thats probably why this strain is said to be psychedelic. One-hitter quitter potential for even the most occasional smoker. For the true stoner? A couple good bong rips will put your head in the sky. Must try for any smoker!!  Potency: **WARNING** THIS BUD IS STRONG, NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE this strain!! It makes me so happy!! I recommend this strain for anyone, but tread with care!! This bitch is strong, and will have you toasted for a long time!! You will love the adventure though, I guarantee it!! ",

Pretty much ruined me for anything less. No longer do biz on SR, and have been bugging her to set up on Cannabis Road, so felt obliged to introduce LexiSadie to the forum.   The OG kush was some of the dankest densest stickiest buds ever, and the thin mint gsc rocked my fucking world...what made it a favorite strain. We kinda lost touch, so it has been a couple months since ordering, but my memory is that stealth was tight and shipping was well within expectations.

Hopefully your coin turns up. Soon Crypto will be up and about and pan everything out with you(as previously stated) just wanted to be another friendly face that gives you some reassurance.

Everything was double vacuum sealed. This is because I was just getting started.   At the end of March I started packaging using MBB and have ever since. The response on stealth/packaging has been good since then.   My stealth is pretty basic in that it's just a MBB inside a box/envelope. It should be dog proof. We use bleach and alcohol to wipe the MBB after packaging. If you open the box you will see the MBB. It's not like MBB inside a box of candy inside another box. It's not designed to get through international customs. My shipping is only domestic however, and the stealth should be sufficient for this purpose. I've never been comfortable shipping internationally so have never offered it.   ",

I go on vacation for a week and everyone thinks the sky is falling, lol. People are way to quick to start pointing fingers.   1) I left a goon in charge while away for the past week. He's not fully trained to do email support. He was supposed to reply to all the messages while I was gone, but I think due to his lack of training on emails he wasn't fully confident in how to respond, so he did not reply to all of them. This is why you see me logging into my account over the past week but not always responding to emails.   2) I'm in South America. The IT end is done there for security reasons. The shipping operations are in California. This is why I'm confident enough to do a clearnet site. Myself, Zelta, they will never find unless they trek deep into the Amazon.   3) Delays: We had so many orders for outdoor we had supply issues the past week. The delays usually go something like this 1) We run low on stock of a particular strain. 2) Supplier says he can get us more tomorrow, hence we feel no need for concern or to email customers. 3) Supplier doesn't come through next day, but says he will have more the following day. 4) Next day goes by and supplier still has not delivered but assures us it will be one more day. 5) After three days we are restocked. 4) Outstanding orders are shipped out 4 days late. 5) Customers are upset and freaking out because their order arrives after 8 or 9 days instead of 2-4 days. The customers who demand urgent refunds are generally the most difficult because there have been a number of times I've refunded an order only for it to arrive the next day. Because shipping is in California and I'm South America, I'm not always able to cancel the shipment in time, so I end up refunding and they get free product.   4) Because I was out of town when we ran out of outdoor, I was unfortunately unable to email everyone who ordered outdoor informing them that there would be a delay. My deepest apologizes about this. Considering the delays were not more than 1 week, it would be nice if people gave me the benefit of the doubt, instead of running around frantic on forums spreading rumors that I've gone rogue or something. I mean, seriously, 1 WEEK I'm gone! Relax everyone. I mean, I know there's a lot of scammers on the darknet and this has everyone jumpy, but my feedback and service has been pretty solid with the exception of January/February when I first started and didn't have my distribution network fully mature, but even in Jan/Feb my orders always arrived within 2 weeks.    5) Now, all of this information that I'm revealing to you, I SHOULDN't HAVE TOO and didn't want too, because it compromises my security. For delays, etc, I prefer to simply say ""technical difficulties"" caused a delay, but people generally get upset at the lack of information. I could have informed everyone ahead of time that I'd be on vacation causing the delay, but this again, compromises my security.   6) Tracking numbers. Because I'm in South America and shipping is in California, I don't always have quick access to tracking numbers. It usually takes me a day or two to get them. I don't normally like getting tracking numbers unless the package is obviously late to a degree that something is wrong. I generally tell people it will take a day or two to get the tracking numbers, and just to give it a few more days to arrive, but they don't usually understand why they can't have the tracking number and get mad. Not to mention the importing of a PGP public key takes time and the package normally arrives after another day or two anyways. I don't really want to reveal the reason the tracking number is difficult for me to obtain is because I'm on a different continent than the shipping operations. However, for security reasons I feel it's better if the IT end is done far away from the shipping operations and that the two should not have any clear connections.   7) The quality of my herb is superb. I have very high standards as to what is allowed to be shipped. If you review my feedback, you'll notice the few complaints I do have are always due to a delay in shipping but never due to low quality herb.     Clearnet site. I was trying to invent a way to make it easier for non-technical people to order. For most people bitcoin is too complicated. 90% of bitcoin users are young males for example. My efforts in developing something like this have not yet succeeded, but I leave the clearnet site up as a way to contact me in case the markets go down. I have been considering taking it down, but am still on the fence about it.   ""Using the above info and common search sites I was able to find at least 5 accounts, links, wallet addresses or other information that COULD lead to tracking down the vendor.  I am talking about things like names or other descriptors that someone can search on and MAYBE find something.    I will not divulge what I found, please don't ask.  It may be nothing or it may be something. I could be barking up the wrong tree and just be a complete doofus. That is for you to decide after doing your own research.""  Non of this leads in anyway to myself. I believe my security is actually far better than 95% of vendors. This is because all of my IT work is done on a different continent than that in which I ship and distribute. My distribution in California has actually never even heard the name zeltasgarden (so even if something were to happen to distribution, it would not compromise zeltasgarden.) Again, this is very sensitive information that I would have preferred remained private. I reveal only reluctantly because I feel, well, that the issues in this thread needed to be addressed in order to retain your confidence.   9) For anyone with a delayed order, again, I am very sorry about this. Everything should arrive very soon, just be patient. I will take measures to help ensure this does not happen again in the future. With the exception of this past week, my service has been extremely solid and reliable and it will remain so in the future. ",

My jaw literally dropped and I had to just shake my head when I saw you finish your small essay by telling the annoyed customer to go fuck themselves. The bottom line is that you made a mistake that caused the situation, and while you seem to understand that somewhat, what you don't understand is how to handle it. I would suggest that next time you just send the customer a message  directly as soon as you possibly can. Make your (potentially security compromising!) explanations there if you have to, offer to give them some bonuses or freebies, and encourage them to delete their thread or post saying how the situation is resolved. Explain how damaging it is to have these forum posts after just a few days. Most people really can understand your perspective if you can convey it well enough.  What you have just done is extremely unprofessional and I would recommend for your sake you delete all of your posts in this thread as soon as possible.  Just my two cents, best of luck either way.  side note: Crypto, I find it a little discomforting when you say you agree with him after that post. I agree customers complaining after 4 days taken out of this context is irritating, but the real issue here is not the shipping time, it's the lack of communication, lack of planning, lack of preparation, and general fuck-upery on the vendor's part. To be perfectly honest there is no real need for a vacation mode if you have your shit together, just set the quantity on all your listings to 0 and put a note on your profile. Worth noting here is that, I suspect, even if you had a vacation mode, Zelta would not have used it. With an untested employee in such a sensitive business there is absolutely no way I would just walk away for a week and expect things to go smoothly.

Zelta's Garden has both a clearnet site and facebook page.  The website utilizes email ordering where they don't require encrypted comms.  The information at these links it is trivial to gain, what I believe, enough information that may make it easier to track down the operator(s) or someone close enough related.  I am not LE or anything close and I don't have the use of the resources that they can use.   They did seem to try to cover their tracks enough that it does take some minor digging  This is simple social reconnaissance and placing relationships on what I saw.    www.facebook.com/zeltas.garden zeltasgarden.com  Using the above info and common search sites I was able to find at least 5 accounts, links, wallet addresses or other information that COULD lead to tracking down the vendor.  I am talking about things like names or other descriptors that someone can search on and MAYBE find something.     I will not divulge what I found, please don't ask.  It may be nothing or it may be something.   I could be barking up the wrong tree and just be a complete doofus. That is for you to decide after doing your own research.  I personally did not spend much time doing this and I used only basic internet skills and I confirmed what I saw.  It is my belief that clearnet vending sites or account should not be intermingled into a darknet vending site or account.  Buyers without regard to their privacy or security is one thing - they are only jeopardizing themselves.  Vendors with bad practices are another ballgame.  Not only are they jeopardizing their own safety and freedom they are jeopardizing all of their clients.     Anyone with a bit of time and internet knowledge can replicate what I did.  Now, imagine someone who has the time and resources to expand on what I saw.  Add to that the ability of LE and USPS to profile packages, expand on wallets, etc.  I don't get a warm fuzzy over it  I do want to get feedback from Zelta and I think they should answer it here on these forums.   It does not look like Zelta has been active on the forums for a month or so.  I'll PM them on the market for them to take a look here. I'll start with just a few questions.  -  Is zeltasgarden.com your site? -  What are your methods of keeping your dealings private and secure?  How do you separate darknet and clearnet transactions, wallets, emails, accounts, etc. -  Generalizing, what methods are you using to ship and not make patterns with your drops?  I ask because...just  look at XanaxKing or CaliGirl and how they were caught. -  It seems that you have attempted to conceal who registered, where it is hosted, (which is good) What are the registrar's and the hosting provider's privacy policy?  Do they work with law enforcement?  Same goes for email providers?

What you will need:  - Disposable gloves (always wear two pairs at once, 1 still leaves fingerprints)  - MBB's. ( I prefer buying it by the role and making my own pouch but you can get ready made ones - visit this thread if you know nothing about them as they are  neccesary don't begin vending without them:  http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=76.0)  - Rubbing alcohol  - Professional looking envelopes/packages  - Labels (with a printer/label maker as printed addresses are a must, for your own safety and the customer)   Okay, so I've covered what you need now here is what you'll need to do:    (I'll be using Cocaine as the example drug in this thread but this procedure goes for ANY drug.)  First off, stick on your gloves. WHAT DID I TELL YOU? That's right, two pairs!  Now, we will begin by weighing out all our Cocaine orders.. Lets say we have maybe.. 10 today. We weigh out each order accordingly keeping them away from the rest of our packaging equitment. I use a totally different room for weighing out/sealing than I do for packaging and printing.  So, your ten orders are all weighted out. Take the currents gloves you have on which are most likely contaminated with miniscule amounts of cocaine - enough to trigger a dogs senses though -, off.  Put on new gloves, again you'll need two pairs for your own safety. Take your MBB pouches and place the freshly weighed out delicous looking drug inside and seal it. Now, apply rubbing alcohol all over the outside of the MBB. This will destroy any trace amounts of the drug lying on the outside of the pouch. Take this small freshly cleaned and sealed pouch and stick it inside another pouch and repeat the process again.  I always recommend at least double, or triple sealing your product with each layer being alcohol washed.   Okay, so at this point the product is clean, sealed and ready to rock 'n' roll. Here's where you'll need an imagination. You need to disguise your product on the inside in case of the event that customs open up one of your packages.   Think about what you've had sent to you, by vendors, or by so called 'legitamate' businesses. What did they have? What was included? Invoices? Gift cards? Little crappy peices of marketing from other businesses like flyers?   I'll leave that for you to decide but be clever about it. Keep it as advanced as possible while making it as simple as possible so it doesn't take you 16 hours everyday to package 3 orders. Another thing, if you ship pills, don't disguise your product as a 'powdered tea' because if customs open it and have a feel, they are going to think 'why is this tea so hard?' Like I said, be clever.   So, at this point I'm hoping you have your product sealed, disguised and your envelope/package sealed up.  What's left to deal with? The outside of your package.   Keep it simple - Printed labels, for both the receivers name and the return addres (always use a return address roughly in the area the product was posted. A return address is neccesary in my opinion, escpecially if you are going all out to disguise it as what business doesn't have a return address?)  You can fire a logo or something else on it if you like, but it's not neccesary but it can make it look nice.  Remember to stick the adequate amount of stamps on, as you don't want your product to be sitting in a postal service sorting office for longer than it needs to be. Plus, your customers will want their drugs asap.  All packaged up and ready to go now are we? I think we are. Take them to the post box then.   HOLD UP.. Did you just carry them to a post box in your own hands? You did.. Well, you've just put your finger prints all over the package. Do you work in any kind of postal service or have any legitimate reason to have touched this personals mail, cause if you don't then you're fucked especially if LE have your prints on file.   Always wear gloves when you are doing a drop, or have something that stops you having a direct touch with the package   I hope this can help some people at least, if you package properly then there really is no reason you or a buyer should be a risk. Of course there will be a few packages that get seized just out of bad luck, but as a whole you'll be good. Be careful, be secure and be safe everyone.    Other things to remember - will be updated often, if you have any input just say and I'll add it:  - When buying stamps, wear gloves or have someone else that doesn't have LE's prints buy them for you. Your prints can end up all over them.  - Use different drops all the time. Try to have like 5-10 that are all a good distance away from each other.  - Never use the same drop two days in a row.  - If you see anything/anyone looking suspicous at the drop, walk away and try a different drop the next day. You never know whos watching.  - And remember to change the appearance of your packaging often to avoid package profiling.",

Have you seen any from April or later? If so, I'd like to see them, please provide a link if you can.   When I first started vending in January/February I did not have the proper equipment for MBB.  Everything was double vacuum sealed. This is because I was just getting started.   At the end of March I started packaging using MBB and have ever since. The response on stealth/packaging has been good since then.   My stealth is pretty basic in that it's just a MBB inside a box/envelope. It should be dog proof. We use bleach and alcohol to wipe the MBB after packaging. If you open the box you will see the MBB. It's not like MBB inside a box of candy inside another box. It's not designed to get through international customs. My shipping is only domestic however, and the stealth should be sufficient for this purpose. I've never been comfortable shipping internationally so have never offered it.   ",

I go on vacation for a week and everyone thinks the sky is falling, lol. People are way to quick to start pointing fingers.   1) I left a goon in charge while away for the past week. He's not fully trained to do email support. He was supposed to reply to all the messages while I was gone, but I think due to his lack of training on emails he wasn't fully confident in how to respond, so he did not reply to all of them. This is why you see me logging into my account over the past week but not always responding to emails.   2) I'm in South America. The IT end is done there for security reasons. The shipping operations are in California. This is why I'm confident enough to do a clearnet site. Myself, Zelta, they will never find unless they trek deep into the Amazon.   3) Delays: We had so many orders for outdoor we had supply issues the past week. The delays usually go something like this 1) We run low on stock of a particular strain. 2) Supplier says he can get us more tomorrow, hence we feel no need for concern or to email customers. 3) Supplier doesn't come through next day, but says he will have more the following day. 4) Next day goes by and supplier still has not delivered but assures us it will be one more day. 5) After three days we are restocked. 4) Outstanding orders are shipped out 4 days late. 5) Customers are upset and freaking out because their order arrives after 8 or 9 days instead of 2-4 days. The customers who demand urgent refunds are generally the most difficult because there have been a number of times I've refunded an order only for it to arrive the next day. Because shipping is in California and I'm South America, I'm not always able to cancel the shipment in time, so I end up refunding and they get free product.   4) Because I was out of town when we ran out of outdoor, I was unfortunately unable to email everyone who ordered outdoor informing them that there would be a delay. My deepest apologizes about this. Considering the delays were not more than 1 week, it would be nice if people gave me the benefit of the doubt, instead of running around frantic on forums spreading rumors that I've gone rogue or something. I mean, seriously, 1 WEEK I'm gone! Relax everyone. I mean, I know there's a lot of scammers on the darknet and this has everyone jumpy, but my feedback and service has been pretty solid with the exception of January/February when I first started and didn't have my distribution network fully mature, but even in Jan/Feb my orders always arrived within 2 weeks.    5) Now, all of this information that I'm revealing to you, I SHOULDN't HAVE TOO and didn't want too, because it compromises my security. For delays, etc, I prefer to simply say ""technical difficulties"" caused a delay, but people generally get upset at the lack of information. I could have informed everyone ahead of time that I'd be on vacation causing the delay, but this again, compromises my security.   6) Tracking numbers. Because I'm in South America and shipping is in California, I don't always have quick access to tracking numbers. It usually takes me a day or two to get them. I don't normally like getting tracking numbers unless the package is obviously late to a degree that something is wrong. I generally tell people it will take a day or two to get the tracking numbers, and just to give it a few more days to arrive, but they don't usually understand why they can't have the tracking number and get mad. Not to mention the importing of a PGP public key takes time and the package normally arrives after another day or two anyways. I don't really want to reveal the reason the tracking number is difficult for me to obtain is because I'm on a different continent than the shipping operations. However, for security reasons I feel it's better if the IT end is done far away from the shipping operations and that the two should not have any clear connections.   7) The quality of my herb is superb. I have very high standards as to what is allowed to be shipped. If you review my feedback, you'll notice the few complaints I do have are always due to a delay in shipping but never due to low quality herb.     Clearnet site. I was trying to invent a way to make it easier for non-technical people to order. For most people bitcoin is too complicated. 90% of bitcoin users are young males for example. My efforts in developing something like this have not yet succeeded, but I leave the clearnet site up as a way to contact me in case the markets go down. I have been considering taking it down, but am still on the fence about it.   ""Using the above info and common search sites I was able to find at least 5 accounts, links, wallet addresses or other information that COULD lead to tracking down the vendor.  I am talking about things like names or other descriptors that someone can search on and MAYBE find something.    I will not divulge what I found, please don't ask.  It may be nothing or it may be something. I could be barking up the wrong tree and just be a complete doofus. That is for you to decide after doing your own research.""  Non of this leads in anyway to myself. I believe my security is actually far better than 95% of vendors. This is because all of my IT work is done on a different continent than that in which I ship and distribute. My distribution in California has actually never even heard the name zeltasgarden (so even if something were to happen to distribution, it would not compromise zeltasgarden.) Again, this is very sensitive information that I would have preferred remained private. I reveal only reluctantly because I feel, well, that the issues in this thread needed to be addressed in order to retain your confidence.   9) For anyone with a delayed order, again, I am very sorry about this. Everything should arrive very soon, just be patient. I will take measures to help ensure this does not happen again in the future. With the exception of this past week, my service has been extremely solid and reliable and it will remain so in the future. ",

My jaw literally dropped and I had to just shake my head when I saw you finish your small essay by telling the annoyed customer to go fuck themselves. The bottom line is that you made a mistake that caused the situation, and while you seem to understand that somewhat, what you don't understand is how to handle it. I would suggest that next time you just send the customer a message  directly as soon as you possibly can. Make your (potentially security compromising!) explanations there if you have to, offer to give them some bonuses or freebies, and encourage them to delete their thread or post saying how the situation is resolved. Explain how damaging it is to have these forum posts after just a few days. Most people really can understand your perspective if you can convey it well enough.  What you have just done is extremely unprofessional and I would recommend for your sake you delete all of your posts in this thread as soon as possible.  Just my two cents, best of luck either way.  side note: Crypto, I find it a little discomforting when you say you agree with him after that post. I agree customers complaining after 4 days taken out of this context is irritating, but the real issue here is not the shipping time, it's the lack of communication, lack of planning, lack of preparation, and general fuck-upery on the vendor's part. To be perfectly honest there is no real need for a vacation mode if you have your shit together, just set the quantity on all your listings to 0 and put a note on your profile. Worth noting here is that, I suspect, even if you had a vacation mode, Zelta would not have used it. With an untested employee in such a sensitive business there is absolutely no way I would just walk away for a week and expect things to go smoothly. These ""goons"" need to be supervised for a long time before they are capable of doing things completely independently, as with any complex task. ",

Zelta at this moment has a 4.9 out of 5 stars for 45 feedbacks.  Zelta has 75 completed sales.  The stats seem quite decent and acceptable.   I COULD BE COMPLETELY WRONG.  DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH AND MAKE YOUR OWN DECISION. I am NOT trying to spread FUD (Fear, uncertainty, doubt - overused acronym).    I am simply a user/buyer just like most of you.  My goals are to be able to come to a market, make a relatively safe transaction where both sides either get their product or their money and are on their way without a second thought of ""Did I do the right thing?  Did I pick the right vendor/product?""  I personally fret out my own vendors and will base my decisions on the information available to me at that time.  I know there's always a few buyers or vendors that are just a ""pain in the ass"" that won't ever be happy.  i've been there myself (I've been lucky and  only on legal purchases).  Now, I don't know if Cindelle is one or if Zelta is one  They could be, they could not be.   You (cindelle) sparked some research into Zelta's garden and what I've personally found or been provided with by others should be taken with a grain of salt.  I don't want to cry wolf or cause Zelta undeserved hardship so I request that they come here and respond.  I'm sure that if we get a response we can hash all this out.  Zelta's Garden has both a clearnet site and facebook page.  The website utilizes email ordering where they don't require encrypted comms.  The information at these links it is trivial to gain, what I believe, enough information that may make it easier to track down the operator(s) or someone close enough related.  I am not LE or anything close and I don't have the use of the resources that they can use.   They did seem to try to cover their tracks enough that it does take some minor digging  This is simple social reconnaissance and placing relationships on what I saw.    www.facebook.com/zeltas.garden zeltasgarden.com  Using the above info and common search sites I was able to find at least 5 accounts, links, wallet addresses or other information that COULD lead to tracking down the vendor.  I am talking about things like names or other descriptors that someone can search on and MAYBE find something.     I will not divulge what I found, please don't ask.  It may be nothing or it may be something.   I could be barking up the wrong tree and just be a complete doofus. That is for you to decide after doing your own research.  I personally did not spend much time doing this and I used only basic internet skills and I confirmed what I saw.  It is my belief that clearnet vending sites or account should not be intermingled into a darknet vending site or account.  Buyers without regard to their privacy or security is one thing - they are only jeopardizing themselves.  Vendors with bad practices are another ballgame.  Not only are they jeopardizing their own safety and freedom they are jeopardizing all of their clients.     Anyone with a bit of time and internet knowledge can replicate what I did.  Now, imagine someone who has the time and resources to expand on what I saw.  Add to that the ability of LE and USPS to profile packages, expand on wallets, etc.  I don't get a warm fuzzy over it  I do want to get feedback from Zelta and I think they should answer it here on these forums.   It does not look like Zelta has been active on the forums for a month or so.  I'll PM them on the market for them to take a look here. I'll start with just a few questions.  -  Is zeltasgarden.com your site? -  What are your methods of keeping your dealings private and secure?  How do you separate darknet and clearnet transactions, wallets, emails, accounts, etc. -  Generalizing, what methods are you using to ship and not make patterns with your drops?  I ask because...just  look at XanaxKing or CaliGirl and how they were caught. -  It seems that you have attempted to conceal who registered, where it is hosted, (which is good) What are the registrar's and the hosting provider's privacy policy?  Do they work with law enforcement?  Same goes for email providers?

Since you've FE'd already I think your options are limited to waiting longer.  Priority mail generally takes 2-4 business days but I've seen it take much longer.  If they shipped it wednesday it might have sat in the box and not gotten processed until thursday.  Thurs, Fri, Sat, Mon, Tue.  We're at 4 delivery/moving days, Maybe 5 if Thurs counts but that all depends on when they shipped and when it was picked up from their drop.  Don't panic just yet.   I always do panic just a little when i have an outstanding order.    ",

So I just wanna take a few minutes to discuss some of the things we have improved on since the site was attacked back at the beginning of February.   The administrators aren't hiding the fact they were exploited and wanna make sure those who register from here on out can be assured that their passwords will be safe and their market won't get compromised again.  You can read about the previous mistakes on  DeepDotWeb   http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/02/09/another-two-bites-the-dust-black-goblin-marketplace-cannabisroad/  The biggest vulnerability is the obvious elephant in the room, sql injection. This shouldn't have ever made it to launch without being taken care of. I have personally worked on this issue myself to make sure all input is sanitized and we're using prepared statements in every place that accesses the database, even where there isn't any user input. But if you find anything I happened to miss, please report it to me immediately and I'll be happy to compensate you for your troubles. Bug bounties are something we take seriously.   Another issue we had was the outright blatant use of the old server's ip address in the forum. As you can see now by viewing the source, there is no use of the new server's ip address on the forum or any place in the market, and neither the forum or market are accessible from clearnet. If you find somewhere that is leaking information about the server, please report it to me immediately and I'll be happy to compensate you for your trouble.   The last major issue was storing passwords in plain text, this was a big mistake by the previous developer and never EVER should have been implemented. We've taken the proper precautions and implemented encrypted passwords with salts.   I've been watching all the other markets and seeing the flaws they've had and how they ended up getting exploited.   Some people believe that recently  MtGox was robbed of 350 million dollars through the transaction malleability ""bug"" or some other flaw in their design. We saw  Sheep Market, Tor Market, Silk Road 2.0, FloMarket and BMR all get looted, possibly because of this. Whether or not these were inside jobs or not, the fact is that there's a big problem with markets holding funds in escrow. We've implemented multisignature addresses in a 2 of 3 fashion so that even if someone were able to hack into our backend, they couldn't steal the coins in escrow without holding at least 2 of the private keys.    Black Goblin was leaking their server ip address through welcome emails being sent over clearnet, port 25 smtp protocol. We've disabled all emails from the server.   Utopia was alleged to have been riddled with XSS vulnerabilities all over their site, especially in the private message section, where apparently the subject form was vulnerable and you could literally pick your targets to send XSS scripts to and gain their session key to login under their account. Then apparently, their back end had no sanitization at all and was able to be exploited. This has been noted and the proper sanitization techniques have been used by us on our server to avoid this from happening to us. Please report any XSS exploits you may find to me immediately. You will be compensated.   Silk Road 1 had several members compromised because of the lack of PGP messaging used through private messaging, and once the servers were seized, the law enforcement could read everything in plain text. We've implemented the ability to PGP encrypt all private messages sent on the market simply by clicking a button, making it much easier for those of you who want to (and you all should) use PGP encryption. Currently this isn't mandatory, but we may switch all private messaging to mandatory PGP encryption in the future.   All PGP  decryption must be done on your computer, not on our server. We refuse to hold any private keys on our server, since this could be used to compromise all your encrypted messages if our server ever becomes compromised.   If anybody finds  any exploits on our servers, please message me right away. I take all reports very seriously and will investigate them personally and will personally compensate you for your troubles.   Since every exploit is unique in it's risk level, we can discuss your compensation in private rather than having set amounts.   Finally, keep the forum safe and peaceful. No doxing, no violence, or anything that goes against our mission of ending prohibition against cannabis.

Cannabis Road 2,a2cf96ad79b48d3d17584cd408560f7b4a687008b7b447e2e82921eeff7fb9a3,240.0,2014-06-11T16:32:32,[SCAM WARNING] kwikeemart ,Market/Rumor Mill,"Thank you for taking the time to reply to our posts kwikeemart, hopefully people will read this whole thread after seeing the title. (Maybe a mod could add a note saying that you've replied to the title).  About FE, Escrow and Pricing: Pricing is a small piece of the puzzle we use to get a picture of you as a vendor. Because of the restrictions of DNMs (which add to our safety), we have to figure out how to put this puzzle together, and for a lot of us its not something weve had to attempt before.   When I first viewed your profile I didn't have a lot of other prices to compare to, I hadn't looked in depth at other markets. Now that there are more listings from Canadian vendors, I can see that you're prices are comparable, and the rest of the world is getting ripped off. (Sometimes a higher than average price can indicate a scam too).  Escrow is like our shield, handed to us by the creators of the market, to protect us against potential scams. And there are times when its quite risky not to use it (new buyer, new market, new vendor etc). Theres nothing wrong with FEing, it just represents putting a great deal of trust in the vendor.   Note to buyers: You can always cancel an order rather than FEing. You should still give new vendors a try, they might be better than the ones youre using now.   The issue I had with your FE policy, was that it was not immediately clear - I can see youve made improvements to your profile and listings, so clarity is no longer an issue - this lead to me not placing an order, in case you requested FE and I had to cancel (this would have resulted in my BTC being tied up for a short time, no great risk).   I wouldnt describe myself as a veteran buyer, just a nerd and DNMs are something I enjoy getting nerdy about. You (kwikeemart) are likely to be dealing with more new buyers than youre used to, because this is a new market, attracting people previously scared of other DNMs. So you may find that you have to do more hand-holding with your buyers than youre used to. Imagine moving to a whole new country, without any way of knowing if youll fit in with the cultural norms, whilst trying to gain an understanding of the laws by reading a hand written note taped to the back of a moving vehicle, thats what starting out on the DNMs felt like.    Another note to buyers: You should exhaust all available methods of communication with a vendor, including messaging on CR, any other mail service they list on their profile, as well as this and other forums, and wait at least 24hrs (longer if indicated in the vendors profile) before using the word scam publicly. You have the right to ask the vendor difficult questions, in the middle of their official review thread if you need to, AS LONG AS YOU ARE POLITE. Politeness wont just make the vendor feel better, it will ensure you get the communication youre looking for. You can also PM vendors on the forums, just remember to use PGP encryption if you want to discuss private things, like shipping methods.   If you as a vendor can stand up to tough questions, whilst remaining polite, then youll find yourself dealing with a better class of buyer, whos more likely to give your product in depth reviews, and give you useful feedback about everything else. I think this type of buyer makes up the minority, and their insights will probably hold more sway than endorsements from other vendors, as they are less likely to benefit financially from that vendor doing well.

For many of us this is a scary place, where we don't have much experience, causing us to act in fear, which leads to the kind of negative response you've seen. It's not fair on you, it's coming out of the current climate in the DNM community which seems to have a new vendor bust report every week (whether that's true or not, that's what it looks like).   It looks like you're being let down by the feedback you've received, over on the main site, four pieces of feedback from low total spend buyers, who seem to be a bit crummy with their written feedback as well. Plus there are (at the time of posting) no reviews of you on the forums here (but I can see that you've made a thread for them now, good idea).   I can see that you've addressed the issues that fordfiesta raised, well done for doing that so quickly.   Just so you know kingmswati's listings are no longer up, and any orders they got were probably on the back of the trust that AfriKanSun gained.  Inconsistencies on a vendor's profile are how we tend to decide between vendors, so users saw your name next to the word scam, and started picking apart your profile for evidence. This post by TBC describes the kind of things we're working from when making decisions to buy:  http://forumzxmoorof4ja.onion/index.php?topic=243.0 The only thing in your profile that might raise a flag now is that you don't have different listings for different strains, as TBC describes that scammers tend to put less effort into their profile and listings, that's why we don't like to see general listings with specifics in your profile. You can run your account however you like, but some people are going to see it this way.   This came up in a reddit search of your username: **Clearnet warning**  http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/1zjila/kwikeemart/ **Clearnet warning** in which one of the mods there describes you as a ""selective scammer"", it looks like you've had some issues with the close of sheep (that closed, right?) - btw the mirror link in your profile isn't going anywhere - and as a result there isn't a lot of written feedback for you floating around.   I'm honestly not sure what more you could do to calm us headless chickens down, but if you want to do more, then I'd suggest talking to some of the vendors here about how they maintain there reputation both on the forums here and the wider web. If you're only vending here, then I would recommend spending time on these forums, just being nice to people (I've noticed you've started posting more, good idea). If you're vending on other markets still, then the DNM subreddit or The Hub are were you'll probably want to focus your attention.  Edit: Also wanted to say that as a skittish buyer, seeing ""FE"" is like seeing a serial killer holding a machete hanging around your profile to me. Somehow the fact that your weed is so cheap isn't working in your favor, it just raises the 'too good to be true' flag. ",

We just duplicated listings which kept the description as the same as the duplicated listing. the 1 and 7g listing were not escrow. We have since improved our business model and all 1 and 7 orders now have escrow for the benefit of the customer. We also added escrow listing of all sizes comparable in price to other top vendors for those who would like the protection of escrow. We ""kwikeely"" put everything together. If you have any other constructive criticism on which we can improve our public image let us know.  We had 0 seizures on Sheep we just kept all of the base text from November. It has all been updated since now. We have had one seizure with a letter given to the UK to be transparent. The user said he already received a letter to his address before and was not surprised his package from me was seized as well. We have had a couple no shows and we always intend on reshipping to honest buyers.  Actually the reason I went with kwikeemart is because on SR1 there was a KwikEmart already and I did not want people to think I was stealing his name. I just liked the annotation and I didnt want him coming back from out of the dark thinking I stole his DW identity. All other discrepancies were just due to a quick going up and expanding our offerings for customers to have more options to purchase from us.  I am not certain if you read my profile like it suggested on all of my listings but you can clearly see the strain currently available is white lightning. I have had two different strains since I started and both of them have been clearly labeled on the vendor profile.  I have not addressed the issues because when people call me a phuck tard and then tell me something is wrong I usually just believe it is trolling and let it be. With a well put together message saying your item descriptions are all over the place can you please update them that would be great just like you talk to people in real life. We can update our listings quickly like we just have. I am not going to treat an interaction here different then I would if it was in real life. If someone spoke to us in such a sarcastic slanderous manner we would not have a conversation that long and probably would never conduct business with them.   So if you find that strange that we do not take requests from ill mannered children that is fine and we will just wait till someone like yourself spells it out in a way that actually makes it seem we will be helping the community we have no problems.  As for refunds we are not just going to refund someone that buys 168g and has 0 purchases everything will be taken on a case by case basis as refunds are tricky but we have experienced in the past customers that have sent us the same address from 3 orders from three separate accounts. We just put all of the order in one package as the 3 orders were going to the exactly same name and address. They claimed only one package showed up which is inherently true but they demanded the 28 and 14g order be refunded and the account that ordered the 7g got there order. But since we put all three orders in the same package something was a miss. By blackmail and extortion it means do not bother sending us a message such as do this for me now or we will give you a bad rating. As we said before we do not take well ill mannered requests and that my friends is extortion of our business reputation. So if you have any problems feel free to contact me. If you have an order in *ESCROW* that does not show up before auto finalization I understand you must put that order in dispute to extend the auto finalization period. What I am stating if you have placed an FE order wait 28 days. 6 weeks is an extreme but you must put a worst case scenario there are many reports of items taking that long. We have had orders in the Christmas/Valentines season that took 30-40 days.   It is funny the one thing that is clearly stated on my profile is you can message me with any questions or comments to help us improve our service. Not a single person asking for answers has sent me a direct message. I dont mind answers questions on the forum but sometimes a direct message would suffice. With the lack of communication the only messages I have received is from lupojack detailing how he has made crypto aware of a legit vendor on CR and that if I send him another PM response I will be banned as vendor. We have done nothing wrong and all packages arrive with premium bud. It is funny how so much distaste has accumulated for a real vendor. When everyone has patience for a dude in South Africa that sent out weed in tin foil..... I am baffled how the inconsistency of evaluating a vendor is so skewed. Oh that is right all of his item descriptions were pristine so the rest of the business model doesnt matter.....  To end it all off like our profile says let us know what else we need to improve on. As we have previously stated ALL *ESCROW* thats right ALL *ESCROW* orders are kept within escrow. We are not trying to sell anyone plated gold here so sorry for the image our disastrous product descriptions sent. All in all I think we off a great service at a competitive price.

Being deprived of Simpsons for your entire life. I recommend going to youtube and searching for ""who needs the kwikeemart"". Or maybe just start on season 1 and watch all 20+ seasons. I guarantee it will make your little life a lot happier! Anyways I will create a review thread now if that makes a difference. I am not looking to service  the entire dark market so if you believe there are better vendors to purchase from by all means conduct business with the best vendor you believe available. We never talk bad of or suggest we are better then our competition we let our actions speak louder then our words. I think the OP of this thread has another name known as riddz he never received his 14g. We reshipped him another 14g he never received...... He has messaged us on this market I offered him one last reship for 10g.  I do not understand why we would have a productive conversation I would resend him a 3rd reship based on faith. Anyways if it is not you riddz I apologize. If you have an issue with a past order SR has our vendor bond which is meant to use to repay any customers that lost out. It should cover a 14g order. I am letting you know now you are coming to the wrong person but I am still dealing with old customers trying to help them out.  The user riddz said he contacted SR and they stated my account had no funds on seizure and that we were already repaid our bond so they could not issue any repayment for his loss...... Funny how a large market that makes 1000s of dollars a day cares so little about there customers and here I am offering this individual a 3rd reship.  We had many premature negative feedback on SR we asked all users to message us before leaving a bad review. Some users would leave a 0 out of 5. And then send us a message saying they want a reship but they already left a 0 out of 5 when it expressed in the message I sent them before the order was sent if you leave a 0 out of 5 you are not eligible for a reship because you cannot update your feedback on SR. It asked all users to wait until no further help could be provided by us before leaving feedback. Many users would leave  feedback in 5 days for a US order when it expressed it took on average 10 days to get to the final destination.   We still reshipped to people that left us bad feedback anyways. The voice is loudest when it is mad and it seems people are not as vocal when I went above and beyond what I needed to do as a vendor there. Which can be frustrating but anyways we still have a pretty steady income stream and we will never be the last vendor so you do not need to worry my friend.  Just keep a look out on my vendor profile as the positive reviews will keep on rolling in.

Kwikeemart - I've always been a firm believer in 'fresh starts'.   I am not personally aware of your history.  If you could explain exactly what happened with the ""scam"" that SR says was happening and I am sure some of us would be willing to at least listen.  One thing you have to remember is that we're all dealing with 'shady business' and trust means everything.   There has to be some basic level of trust going before anyone will order.  Also I think that TheBestCannabis has a post at  http://forumzxmoorof4ja.onion/index.php?topic=243.0 on at least his (good) methodology for protecting himself against scams.   It is good reading for both vendors and buyers. What I'm stating here is just my opinion.  Others may think differently.  I think the biggest takeaway in your case might be the section:  Looking at your listings: 1.  The one that I looked at that states ESCROW in the title then says All orders require FE in the description.  Didn't check any others. 2.  AAA Kush, what is that?  Hybrid?  What strains?  What effects?.  Need to go to your profile page to find it. 3.  Clearer pictures of the actual product.  Not generic pics that you use for all your listings.  People want to see what they are going to get. 4.  Setup a review topic on these forums.  Participate 5. ""For some peak seasons, and rural locations packages will take up to 6 weeks. Please wait at least 28 business days before thinking your package is not going to show up. ""  this is scary as fuck.  Why that long? ","Another seriously important red flag is the perceived ""effort"" they have put into their profile, listings, etc. This is hard to quantify and describe, and probably even harder for buyers to understand as they aren't setting up vendor accounts. But just look at their profile, their listings, their pictures, their forum postings, the total cumulative efforts they have put into their name and business. How much time do you think it took them? A few minutes? A few hours? A few days? Depending on what you are purchasing and how big your purchase is, this should be a huge factor in your mind. For me, looking at a profile like CannabisCompany, I can only imagine the profile was set up in less than 30 minutes at most: there are a total of 3 or 4 paragraphs at best, which appears to have been written by someone with a 5th grade grasp of English with a disdain for spell check. Now there is nothing inherently wrong with running a business that didn't take a lot of effort to set up, but I would use an analogy to describe this: Lemonade stand."

All orders do not require FE if you actually browsed my profile we would see we have ESCROW and non escrow listings available. We have sent out many orders on CR and Pandora.

Does it make sense to you that a scammer would leave all of there scammed funds from SR in the SR wallet and the funds from all of our other market profits we had as well. We left our money in the SR wallet due to good faith and naive belief. All the money we had in that account is gone ""scammed"" some would say. Sorry if you feel unattended to but our account was shut down for your ""security"" by SR operators if you want a refund you must now speak to them ask for some of the money they repossessed from our account. Obviously they suspended our account not for the users but for public perception as they did not give a penny of the large some of money confiscated to the users they were supposedly trying to protect.

Cannabis Road, at least to me, is a different kind of market.  For some unwarranted reason I have more trust in this market than others BUT all I can say is ""don't fuck with my money"".   FE totally removes any leverage that a buyer has.    I can say that before I buy from any vendor I 'research the shit outta them'.  All 3 sides of the transaction requires trust.  Out of the 3 sides, two are unknown.  I know my intentions but I do not know the intentions of the seller or the market. If anything seems fishy or requires FE at all I move on because there are many other fish in the sea.  Only when the balance of trust tips into the minimum range will I go thru with an order.  Don't get me wrong, I am not saying you are dishonest.  For all I know you could be a fine and upstanding citizen returning lost wallets and helping old ladies across a busy street.  I realize by me having a noFE rule I may miss out on the best product or vendor but that is the chance I take.  I don't just give my money away unless I'm at a blackjack table.  Even then I only gamble with what I can lose. escrow and Multisig are sort of like buying insurance when a dealer is showing an ace and you have nothing.   Don't buy insurance and the dealer shows 21...hand over..you get nothing.
